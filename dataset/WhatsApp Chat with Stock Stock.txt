6/5/20, 9:16 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I took the risk :). Bought a couple of hundred at the peak and then came down by 15%. Let’s see.
6/5/20, 9:16 PM - +1 (732) 742-4190: Good info 👌👌
6/5/20, 9:19 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Still market goes up another 800...Whats going on? One view is that market is still undervalued 20%🙂. And majority of investors are still out. Once then come on board, expect more rally....I don’t expect (personal view) any major correction before election...Things can change drastically post election result.
6/5/20, 9:20 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Jesus.
6/5/20, 9:23 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: We should see a big correction in next week
6/5/20, 9:23 PM - +1 (732) 742-4190: I agree with you.  👍👍

6/5/20, 9:28 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Do you think Sensex will come down? India has not reached peak yet and situation may be a lot worst....I exited indian market and now feel like stupid :(.

6/5/20, 10:18 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Dear, the point is that It should have seen the correction already. We have been talking about this. But market is not stopping...You may be right this time but my rule during pandemic has been - don’t try to predict the market and bet on your prediction....My theory since April has been stay long. Don’t exit....And that’s what’s been working so far... I will be stay invested until Nov20. And then see.

6/8/20, 5:03 PM - +1 (732) 799-8114: Motivation :)
6/8/20, 5:05 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 1. As chinese economy comes back, growth in car sales could be a forward looking indictator (particularly luxury segment) of the strength of the consumer market. This could be modelled as the path forward for other economies looking to open up. 

2. For people having a tough time, trying to figure out what the market is doing, US is going to see the best economic data, that it will see in the history of the country. 

3. Historical employment gains each month average around 200k give or take. Between now and election, the economy will see 1-2MM jobs creation each month, as people return to work.

4. Similarly 3rd quarter and probably 4th quarter GDP growth rate will in be double digits after the big drawdown in the 2nd quarter

5. While the market is no doubt expensive relative to history, its not overly expensive if we consider 2021 earnings. A 10% fall in the market will bring it in-line with longer term averages. I would be happy to see a bigger drawdown, as it will provide an opportunity to buy, but it seems less probable given the history.
6/8/20, 5:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The best charts  summarizing my longer term bullish thesis is 1) Investors  underallocation to equities versus longer term averages in a yield deprived world for bonds 2) The unprecedented amount of liquidity compared to GFC and anything that we seen in our lifetime.

6/8/20, 5:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The biggest short term risk to the market is the amount of speculative call options in the market.  (Contrary sentiment indicator). This needs to correct.
6/8/20, 5:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
6/8/20, 5:30 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I dont believe in earnings coming back anytime soon. Without earnings, investing into stock is like investing in nothing. We will have to see the employment recovery. We starting from 16.6% unemployment. In 2009, we started with 10% unemployment. Important to see, how many of 16.6% unemployed go back to work.
6/8/20, 5:30 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I think if we recover to 8% level unemployment, markets will come roaring back.
6/8/20, 5:31 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: If we stop around 10%-11%; holding up earnings will be impossible for most businesses.
6/8/20, 5:31 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: Your analysis (speaking for myself and my investing style) has been 90% spot on! Thank you for providing your insights here regularly!!
6/8/20, 5:32 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It will be difficult to hold current valuations.
6/8/20, 5:33 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Infact, we might see spike in commodity inflation alongside stocks deflating. Deadly situation it will be. Fed wont be able to support by printing, and recovery will be hard to come by.
6/8/20, 5:40 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Thanks Indraniel. We live in crazy times.
6/8/20, 5:41 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: 👍🏽 🙏🏾
6/8/20, 5:46 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I dont have anything else to comment. My analysis (as it has done in the past) should speak for itself. 

1. I became bearish in the market when S&P fell below 3000

2. I started buying and urged people to buy below 2500, including the S&P 2200 handle. 

3. People who have listened to me particularly buying tech stocks must be killing this year. Nasdaq is at all times high and is the best performing sector.

4. I was pounding on the table that march 23rd is the bottom, as long as S&P above 2500. 

5. I currently don't think that market can fall below 2700. If it goes there, one should load up the boat. 

6. I have also made the below forecast and it is in black and white to see what we will achieve longer term.
6/8/20, 5:46 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: From a longer term perspective, 2009 is the start of the bull market. Market moves in 5 impulse waves per Elliott Wave theory, and my count suggests that market completed a 4 wave down on Mar 23rd and have taken up for the last and final 5th wave up and herein below are the levels that market may ultimately reach over the next few years (with different probabilities)

1. 3400-3500 - High
2. 4000 - High
3. 4500 - Medium 
4. 5000 - Low/Medium
5. 5500 - Low
6. 6000 - Very Low 

Obviously market will not go up in a straight line, but will have many whip saws in between, but people with long term view will be adequately rewarded.
6/8/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Market will reflect true state of underlying economy. If market is kept artificially up with money printing, than value of money will adjust. But it reverts to reflecting true economic conditions. SP500 will go to 5000-6K and even more, just that we need get timings right on it. Current valuations are more reflective of devaluation of $ vs underlying economics. I will stay away from making long term investments without getting more confidence in earnings. Currently, stock market is behaving like casino with no done side risk.
6/8/20, 6:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Markets are always forward looking in nature. I dont disagree that valuations have become stretched as I have said in my comments above. But there are a number of drivers to the market than just the earnings. The PE multiple for bonds are above 100 vs stocks which is less than 20 based on 2021 earnings. In a world filled with cash what other alternatives are there for institutional investors who are getting criticized for underperforming. Valuations by the way are a poor proxy of trend reversals. 

 People who wait too much often miss the boat,  as have happened with many investors. Market will react faster than earnings react. It always work the opposite direction. 

Price is the ultimate arbitrator. Things needed to make money in the market 

1. Dont argue with Fed
2. Follow the longer term trend 
3. Buy when there is blood on the street. 
4. Keep an eye on valuations but not be obsessed with it. 

If only investors can understand the above items, they will do really well in the long term.
6/8/20, 6:16 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: 👍
6/8/20, 6:18 PM - +1 (732) 956-6246: 👍
6/8/20, 6:21 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, forwarding looking earnings is the issue. Earnings and cost of capital are primary driver. Cost of capital was reduced to almost zero by fed engineering (not surprising), but if earnings don't come, how do you justify valuations?
6/8/20, 6:22 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Unless fed reserve starts buying stuff from Costco, walmart, Amazon with printed money, they can't stimulate earnings.
6/8/20, 6:23 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I am very clear, show me the earnings and take my money. Otherwise, I have better places to park than casino without control.
6/8/20, 6:26 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Confidence in future earnings and estimates are all over the place. And stocks are super expensive right now. Be careful. Stock markets just don't go one way.
6/8/20, 6:27 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Do think warren buffet missed the boat 🚣‍♂️?
6/8/20, 6:32 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: some scary tweets, advise to visa holders to get inside as soon as possible if you are outside the USA

6/8/20, 6:34 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Warren buffet doesn't know about power of Elliot wave theory 😀
6/8/20, 6:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Great question, I think Warren has not been as effective as he was in the past. I respect the legend, but here are his mistakes 

1. Did not buy and adhere to his principle of being greedy when there was blood in the street in March.  Market was 35% down which was the average of all bear markets. The maximum market has fallen is roughly 50%. He should have bought at that time, because risk to the downside was limited vs the reward to the upside.

2. He sold airlines at the wrong time. Airlines are cyclical stock whose earnings will be depressed this year, but that was already factored on price, as most of them were trading 50-70% discount. Airlines have roared back since then.

3. He has underperformed the index over the last 10 years, because of his exposure to cyclical stocks (energy and airlines) and being underweight to tech stocks who are ruling the world. 

So yes, unfortunately I think he has missed the boat.
6/8/20, 6:35 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I agree Warren buffet has been more wrong then right
6/8/20, 6:36 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And many others who don't understand get pie on their face sitting on cash
6/8/20, 6:36 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Doesn't surprise me
6/8/20, 6:38 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, it is fundamental law of universe. Stocks move according to Elliott wave theory. All other investors are idiots to use other methods, they should just look at chart and swiggle Elliot wave, and carry on.
6/8/20, 6:39 PM - +1 (262) 955-5134: How did the market work before the era of earnings call? There is got to be other ways. What if the is a cyber attack and we are left with no option than to go tribal ways (better ways) to doing things.
6/8/20, 6:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Investors should look at everything they think can help improve their performance
6/8/20, 6:40 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: People always invested based in future earnings potential of asset, since man stopped being hunter gatherer.
6/8/20, 6:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And who is to say the future earning potential is not good.
6/8/20, 6:41 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: In tribal society, there was no need for investing.
6/8/20, 6:41 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Man will kill whatever it could to eat.
6/8/20, 6:42 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Man would fuck whatever it could to procreate.
6/8/20, 6:42 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Life was simple and easy.
6/8/20, 6:43 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Great. We are back to talking fundamentals rather than chart patterns.
6/8/20, 6:43 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Earnings are highly correlated to spending which is highly correlated to jobs.
6/8/20, 6:44 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: So unemployment recovery is key number to watch.
6/8/20, 6:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah, we can talk anything under the sun related to stock market
6/8/20, 6:44 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Anything above 8%, we will have sloppy earnings nothing compared to what we get at 4% unemployment.
6/8/20, 6:45 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: With below 8%, which ppa type stimulus we can be back to 4-5% levels, but it will take another 1.5-2 trillion.
6/8/20, 6:46 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ok, where is the data that suggests above 8% stock market does not perform well?
6/8/20, 6:46 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: We are at 16.3% right now.
6/8/20, 6:46 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 13.5%
6/8/20, 6:46 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: We added 2 million jobs
6/8/20, 6:46 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Na, it is 16.3%, it was corrected over weekend.

6/8/20, 6:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Facts
6/8/20, 6:48 PM - +1 (262) 955-5134: Why are we forgetting the COVID-19 cure (medicine/syringe) as the fundamental thing that has to be in place.

6/8/20, 6:48 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Then get your facts right.
6/8/20, 6:50 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, that is big hurdle. Everyone above 50 age will hold back on lots of activities.
6/8/20, 6:50 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If you follow it like I do, you would notice that the margin of error is huge that you can d we aw a bus through it
6/8/20, 6:50 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Draw a bus
6/8/20, 6:50 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: This gets corrected 3 times
6/8/20, 6:50 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, we are at 16.3% till next correction.
6/8/20, 6:50 PM - +1 (262) 955-5134: Those that hold the key to that, will hold the market at their feet.
6/8/20, 6:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ok what is the magic about 8%
6/8/20, 6:53 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Post 2008 recovery, earnings didn't improve much until unemployment rate was brought around 8%. We got recovery in earnings as soon as we dipped below 8%.
6/8/20, 6:53 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: From 10.5% to 8% was excruciating journey.
6/8/20, 6:54 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Trillion was spend. Once we breached 8%, we saw positive market cycle became self sustaining.
6/8/20, 6:54 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: We saw improvement to 4% and roaring economy.
6/8/20, 6:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ok, another check. The stock market bottomed in 2009, when unemployment was 8.7%. It went up to a high of 10+ %. After the bottom was hit, when unemplyment was going up, stocks have the best returns in 2009 (I dont know 60%)
6/8/20, 6:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Stock market predicted that unemployment rate will peak and started doing well rather than the other way round.
6/8/20, 6:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Nothing is stopping it to do this time around (as it has been exactly doing this) by going up 30%
6/8/20, 6:59 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Okay. Please keep investing into stonks then.
6/8/20, 7:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Markets perform their best when things go from more bad to less bad. Markets bottomed on Mar 23rd, because unemployment claims peaked the next week.
6/8/20, 7:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its more smarter than us
6/8/20, 7:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Always had been
6/8/20, 7:00 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Well, let's see how it goes. I think market will bottom again if earnings confidence doesn't come back.
6/8/20, 7:01 PM - +1 (262) 955-5134: A lot of strong market makers who control the market, have no basic knowledge about connection between unemployment and market movement. They do not care. It is the Finance Guys, who churn numbers and try to make a sense of a lot of things, connect these dots to make a pattern or something. Do you agree??
6/8/20, 7:01 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: And in my estimate, it earnings will keep failing and can easily drive market to double bottom scenario.
6/8/20, 7:02 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Na, unemployment numbers are lead indicator of economic recovery.
6/8/20, 7:03 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It's the one metric on whose calculation, USA government spends millions.
6/8/20, 7:03 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: If fed keeps buying everything including junk, fundamentals won't matter as long as liquidity drives momentum.
6/8/20, 7:04 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, but it cannot keep buying till infinity. It will destroy US dollar if commodity inflation sets in.
6/8/20, 7:05 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Mathematically, fed can print infinity,, but then value of dollar against commodities will shoot up into sky. That will bring production into halting grind.
6/8/20, 7:05 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It's one hell of the problem to solve.
6/8/20, 7:06 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Paycheck program covered up lot of unemployment numbers drop. Stimulus checks covered personal savings drop. 68% people earned more than what they earn if they are in a job. U can see how manipulated these numbers are and they cannot be an indicator of economy now, may be till elections are over
6/8/20, 7:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Got to go guys. I hope market falls, and provide all with the opportunity who did not get the chance last time. Unfortunately, the market knows that every ones is waiting for double bottom, and may not provide this opportunity. Again as I said, its smarter than all of us.
6/8/20, 7:07 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, 15 days back lots of people were expecting double bottom,, now lots of people are expecting multi year bull market.
6/8/20, 7:08 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, you can argue that number may not be accurate. But it's not pretty by any scale.
6/8/20, 7:38 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: I am on the same boat hope for the best
6/8/20, 9:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Hmm. This is not the time to buy. Market has been overextended for sometime now. We have an overhead resistance around 3250, the naked call ratio chart makes me nervous, and VIX was up today when no one was noticing. Nothing major, but all the recipe for a few percentage pullback... doesn't change the longer term narrative though, let's see what it has in mind.
6/8/20, 9:18 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Is it good time for profit booking ?
6/8/20, 9:27 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Penny stock? I have few other penny and I am not taking any more :(.
6/8/20, 9:31 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: WT....Look at 52 week high low, and then 182% up today and then after market news about filing bankruptcy....
6/8/20, 9:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: All stock charts will be different, but generally speaking given the rally we had, some profit booking may not be a bad idea for traders.

As an investor,  I dont take profit unless we reach all time highs and then every 5%-10% increases. I hedge my portfolio using downside etf only when I see reversal candles at relevant levels like today.
6/8/20, 9:34 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: That ways, you own your core position and your hedge offset the losses from stocks in the portfolio.
6/8/20, 9:35 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 😂
6/8/20, 9:42 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: 👍we can sell some for profit and hold the core position
6/8/20, 9:42 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: I do that

6/8/20, 9:46 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Earning may take a dip for a couple of quarters or may be three. Afterwards will come back to normal...Where else you will put your money in this zero interest scenario?
6/8/20, 9:46 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Awesome, the biggest risk in selling the core position is that there is a possibility that you will have to buy higher, if you act smart. Unless the story changes of why you are holding the stock, the time to hold is forever. You can obviously skim the gravy from time to time as needed. 

Let your winners run. Compounding is the 8th wonder of the world. Anyone who understand it earns it :-)
6/8/20, 9:48 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Might have...no one has a crystal ball...or you never know...will only know what he has done when he declares his next earning.
6/8/20, 9:48 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Awesome !!! Need some help on day trading.. today I subscribed day trading option in RH
6/8/20, 9:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: One of the high quality companies that I want to build a core position in. But it keeps running away from me.
6/8/20, 9:49 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: @Sushant K
6/8/20, 9:50 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Sorry I never wanted to interrupt your thought to come in. Which is always helpful to group.
6/8/20, 9:51 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I agree here Nash...He was wrong on airline. I did not enter for quite some time just because he sold AA. But finally went in and United is my best performance stock with over 50% return.
6/8/20, 9:52 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Many of the books that u read related to stock market. The common sentence u see is "let u r winners run for u"
6/8/20, 9:52 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Fortunately today I didn’t let it go, and took ride on it. Thursday is the earnings and I don’t want to take that risk , will try to get out of this.
6/8/20, 9:52 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Hey Niraj, I am curious as how is your 10 cent USO option doing? Must be at amazing return already...I missed it.
6/8/20, 9:53 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Sure Manish bhai
6/8/20, 9:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Be careful though. Its an extremely cyclical industry and can come down as fast as it goes up. I dont like airlines. I bought speculative position in BA at $130 when it was selling at ridiculous levels. I will be out of it when trend reverses though
6/8/20, 9:54 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Our @17325013097 Anand bhai is expert
6/8/20, 9:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: awesome. 

Question - I know option trading is a hit and miss thing, how does it go for you in general. Are you happy with your returns?
6/8/20, 9:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Returns on average over a large sample of trades.
6/8/20, 9:56 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: So far I am really happy , most of the time I don’t play naked options. But returns are really good compare to regular stocks.
6/8/20, 9:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Good to hear that you don't play naked
6/8/20, 9:58 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Generally i buy long term options and keep getting returns every alternate weeks.
6/8/20, 9:59 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: I also have the same strategy. But what is returns every week thing ?
6/8/20, 9:59 PM - +1 (732) 742-4190: Too much gambling $$$$$$$$$I have to read 130 message.
6/8/20, 10:00 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Keep selling the Options, like your fortnightly rent from your long term options
6/8/20, 10:00 PM - +1 (732) 742-4190 left
6/8/20, 10:00 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Don’t be greedy in selling options
6/8/20, 10:02 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: @17322363427  aap to gyani log hain sanjay bhaiya 🙏
6/8/20, 10:02 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: How do you identify reverse trend? I have 5 options and I sold two days back. Wish I had stayed a few more days in...
6/8/20, 10:04 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There are a number of ways, I will tell you the easiest one. Tell me the name of stock that you missed by selling early
6/8/20, 10:04 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Was it draftking
6/8/20, 10:05 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Delta
6/8/20, 10:05 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: There are so many good stocks to buy. But if you have even $100,000. You can buy only 10-15 of them. Rest even if you know the sre good and has a potential you are bounded. Long term options gives you width with lot underlying stocks. So prefer that.
6/8/20, 10:05 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: I missed to buy QQQ long term, now its too expensive.
6/8/20, 10:06 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I was doing covered call on DraftKings and missed some earning opportunities because of mad run...Then I bought again at 42.50... so yes...
6/8/20, 10:07 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I missed BA by selling early. And have Coca-Cola 55 for July 17th...HAL and XOM all for July with good return so far...
6/8/20, 10:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
6/8/20, 10:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 1. I have attached 1 hr chart for delta. 

2. The chart is an uptrend since May 18th. I know this, because my line is moving up

3. Early June the stock went parabolic, so I needed a steeper white line

4. As long as the white line does not break i will not sell my stock. Which line you want to choose depends on your risk tolerance. 

5. The above chart suggests that if I have bough Delta below $20, I would have still hold it at $37, for more than 80% return. 

6. Similar lines could be drawn for all stock in uptrend. Don't sell your winners and sell if trend breaks.
6/8/20, 10:20 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Is one day down is a trend break?
6/8/20, 10:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its a hourly chart, so a few candles below the white line should be a red flag
6/8/20, 10:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Similar analysis can be done on daily chart
6/8/20, 10:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Only applicable for trading portfolio. I would not do this on my investment portfolio.
6/8/20, 10:28 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Do you also see the 9 Day MA, volumes and gaps?
6/8/20, 10:29 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Since I mostly like to take long term positions, I look at longer term averages (20 and above) and longer term support and resistance. 

Yes to volumes and gaps
6/8/20, 10:32 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Commodities. I bought oil, uranium, gold, silver and miners.
6/8/20, 10:32 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Commodities have value in itself. It doesn't need to show cash flow
6/8/20, 10:32 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Got it. Thanks Nash 🙂
6/8/20, 10:34 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👌🏻

6/8/20, 10:38 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Still holding

6/9/20, 6:47 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: XLE —> keep or sell?
6/9/20, 8:14 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I treat energy sector as cyclical sector, as long as the trend is up, hold on.
6/9/20, 8:38 AM - +1 (717) 385-7085: I would like to buy more for long term.🤣🤣🤣

6/10/20, 12:19 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Doesn’t hurt to start with smaller positions. But it takes lot of time for them to compete with Tesla.
6/10/20, 12:22 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: are not they noth in different segments?

Nikola primary on trucks and Tesla in cars and pick up truck
6/10/20, 12:23 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: both**
6/10/20, 12:23 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Yes. That’s what I read.
6/10/20, 12:23 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: That’s why I said it takes long time for them to compete with Tesla.
6/10/20, 12:24 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: 👍
6/10/20, 12:24 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: One thing caught my attention is their trucks have better mileage than Tesla
6/10/20, 12:33 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I wonder if these 2 companies have any relation to the legendary scientist Nikola Tesla.
6/10/20, 12:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Unless you get an allocation at the listing price, research suggest IPO typically offer poor returns in the first 6 and 12 months. There are number of reason including

 1) Lock out typically period expires 90-180 days, meaning early investors will be exiting and dumping their shares later on. 

2. Investors will start getting familiar with the company as they start providing quarterly results, and they start assessing and comparing the company through a number of metrics (conservatove lens).  

3. The exhuberance of initial price appreciation comes to the ground a) As underwriters/institutional investor disappear after creating a market early on b) retail traders who jumped in early kept holding the bag also dump their shares. 

Not commenting on the company above, but in general this area should be approached with caution.
6/10/20, 12:35 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: There is one more competitor- Rivian
6/10/20, 12:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am assuming traders got out of airlines, after the trend line is broken. I sold my BA position yesterday after a 70% gain as this was always intended to be a speculative position.
6/10/20, 12:42 PM - +1 (727) 248-1546: I did the same. When we can reenter again?
6/10/20, 12:43 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Lockout period for 6-12 months. Is it blanket rule? Or varies from company to company?
6/10/20, 12:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Varies
6/10/20, 12:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I typically avoid cyclical companies, unless they are close to the lows, so not interested in getting in again. There will be a continuous pressure on this industry. From technical perspective BA will have support at $185, $175 and around $160. Typically you would want to see the share touching these levels and bounce from it for a position.

6/11/20, 11:52 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 1. This is a 4 hr chart of the S&P. S&P has been operating in this channel since it started its uptrend, which is ~2 months. 

2.   The top end acted as resistance and the bottom as support. The market has hit the top and the bottom multiple times

3. It broke the uptrend, with low volumes and huge spec position on call options. That was unsustainable

6/11/20, 4:46 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: *Fed leaves rates unchanged until 2022 – and markets are all over the place!*

Stock Market Update Wednesday, June 10th, 2020

Today all eyes were on the Fed.
Stocks dropped after the open, then moved sideways with traders waiting for the FOMC Statement and Press Conference this afternoon.
At 2pm ET the Fed voted to keep rates unchanged, with rates not expected to increase until late 2022.
Although there weren’t really any surprises in the Fed’s decision, the Fed predicts that the  U.S. economy would likely see a 6.5% decline this year. And Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the recovery after the pandemic “is going to take some time.”
Stocks initially rallied after the Fed Statement. But after multiple attempts to push higher, the DOW  and S&P dropped and ended lower for the second consecutive day.
But the NASDAQ was another story.
*The NASDAQ closed above 10,000 for the first time in history!*
 According to  Marketwatch, it was the fastest 1,000 point move (from 9,000 to 10,000) since the year 2000.
Here’s where the major markets ended the day:
MARKETS
S&P3,190-17-0.5%
DOW26,990-282-1.0%
NASDAQ10,020+66+0.7%
CRUDE OIL39.40+.46+1.2%
GOLD1720.4-1.5-0.1%

As of market close
Stocks rallying on optimism over the reopening of the economy were hit hard today. United Airlines (UAL) lost 11.0%  and American Airlines (AAL) closed 8.3% lower likely due to profit taking after the massive rally in the past 2 days.
But companies like  Slack (WORK)  and  Microsoft (MSFT)  were winners,  up 3.7%  each as traders focused on companies that will benefit from the “work from home” movement. In fact today’s rally helped Microsoft finish at record highs.
Tesla (TSLA) crossed a major milestone as well today, busting past the $1,000 mark for the first time ever. Tesla ended the day with a 9.0% gain.

6/11/20, 5:35 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Omg 😳!!
6/11/20, 7:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Is this a one day wonder or the market has more to go? Although as expected, market came to my numbers, I did not like today's close towards the low. If market symmetry is to play out, and we are going to go behind the woodshed tomorrow as we did today, around 2865 should be the next area of support. But that doesnt mean, I am a buyer at that price.  Typically you should not  catch a falling knife, let market do what it has to do, wait for reversal candle and then take a position.

 It is notable that the importance of support and resistance is two fold.  1. It either is used for taking profits or 2) market reverses from there. If market reverses, than its the final destination.

6/15/20, 12:39 AM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Stock Market is driven by only 2 emotions fear and greed. In March fear was at the peak because  it was totally new situation. It was a fear of unknown. As people started getting handle of the situation and new information started coming in. The market got over it. Yes. It is the most hated market rally. All those who were sitting on the fence cursing about the opportunity lost. It is a fact that market is ahead of current state of the economy. Apart from few sectors things are moving. And as stated keep opening up things will normalize gradually with a new normal and way of living. Market will fall so that economic reality is balanced out but not to that extreme we saw in March. Currently it is at the make or break point. It can go both ways. It can be melt up or it can be melt down. But a true trader or investor does not buy a stock and starts praying and his emotion goes up and down with rhe index. Market presents opportunity both ways. Just ride and act not just watch the ticks of your overall portfolio balance every second.

6/16/20, 12:40 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: but this is not trump, every county, central bank are started doing this. As i know they are flowing cash into the market but buying bonds to keep their currency value..
6/16/20, 12:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Asset price bubble
6/16/20, 12:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 1) Every country is doing this but not to the extent of US, where you are stimulating 20-30% of the GDP. A large portion of which channels to the market. 

2) Global markets also trades at a significant  discount to US at levels not seen in 30 or so years. So the bubble burst will have a larger impact to US 

3) Most developing countries  do not have  zero interest rate like developed countries, so they will not have to resort to unconventional policy measures.

What this means for H1B applications:

1. Full 3-year approval for H1B extension, transfer, or amendment irrespective of the client letter duration.
2. No need to submit a client letter as a mandatory pre-requisite document.
3. Fewer RFEs and faster H1B approval times.
4. H1B itinerary is not required and will not be used to deny the application.

H1B bench and training time policies have been made strict!
Give from one hand and take from other!

More information check below PDF

H1B news: All employees working at client locations Employee-Employer and Contracts are NOT mandatory now. USCIS issued a memo.

6/29/20, 3:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: BA is in a long term triangle, and it will consolidate within the range for a very long time. The high of the triangle is $300 and could be used to short the stock, the low is $140, which can be used to buy the stock. Since the stock has more upside than downside, there is nothing wrong in holding the stock. If it breaks the level above, depending on where it broke, could be bullish or bearish
6/29/20, 3:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Fundamentally, the good news on 737 max is just getting started. I dont sell uptrending stock early.
6/29/20, 3:17 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Thanks
6/29/20, 3:17 PM - +1 (773) 364-0061: thanks for  ur inputs
6/29/20, 3:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 737 is the highest selling aircraft, if they got all tests certified by the FAA and remove the grounding order, its hard to see that the stock won't rally.
6/29/20, 3:18 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Sorry I can’t see your full name other than Nash
6/29/20, 3:18 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Thanks that helps
6/29/20, 3:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The big risk is when people start flying again, and the changes they bring to the design to the aircraft, unless that is sorted, the stock will not move yo all time high
6/29/20, 3:20 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Sometimes your Divedend is better than the interest and yes leveraged position has both upside and downside.
6/29/20, 3:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So, it depends on your view of vaccine, treatment and comfort level of people flying again.
6/29/20, 3:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I like to keep it that way :-)
6/29/20, 3:22 PM - +1 (773) 364-0061: what ur name btw

6/29/20, 3:28 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Thank you Parag. Now I am completely enlightened about risks of using margin. Do you know why I am not allowed to borrow against margin in Robinhood?
6/29/20, 3:30 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: In 2000 Dot com bubble my total account balance was $-2.00. Detek liquidated my entire account. The market fell so fast and I was out on an Office Party. Those times we had no smart phones or wi fi. I was watching market going down down on CNBC in the hotel. When came back and checked my account it was -2.  I lost $20,000k. Almost all my savings.
6/29/20, 3:30 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: better call and ask RH support

6/29/20, 4:02 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: 40% capacity was lost due to close down in Q2
6/29/20, 4:03 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Tesla has huge demand, but this quarter is all about how much they can manufacture and deliver.
6/29/20, 4:04 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Almaeda county played huge spoiler for Tesla. Remember, Tesla had open fight on twitter with Almaeda county officials
6/29/20, 4:05 PM - +1 (732) 799-8114: @15166068934   do you think at this time we can play PUT on tesla ?
6/29/20, 4:06 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: So painful to witness such numbers. Did you recover that money later on?
6/29/20, 4:07 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: No, tesla is highly volatile. Market is expecting 70K car deliveries and loss of $400m. I think tesla will come close or beat that expectations by little.
6/29/20, 4:08 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It wont be at breakeven.
6/29/20, 4:09 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Thanks for sharing your experience

6/29/20, 4:21 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: And there is no quick money here.
6/29/20, 4:22 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: 100% ✅.

6/29/20, 4:39 PM - +1 (201) 736-9742: श्रध्दा और सबुरी 🙏🙏😀
6/29/20, 4:45 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: If you really deep dive, secret of successful investing is to buy what federal reserve is buying. Being in alignment with monetary stimulus has worked like charm for last 20 years.
6/29/20, 4:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👆I did not say anything different about Fed couple of weeks ago.
6/29/20, 5:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And 3 other bullets to complement it
6/29/20, 5:10 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, but you can always do much better than aligning with fed by investing in companies with strong narrative.
6/29/20, 5:11 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: In normal times, I follow simplest way of investing and it has yielded 20% return yoy.
6/29/20, 5:11 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Find companies with great products and services, check if adoption curve is trending up, then buy on dips.
6/29/20, 5:12 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Hold that stock till narrative becomes widely accepted and almost clinche. Take profit
6/29/20, 5:16 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Apple, Google, Nvidia, Dominos, Chipotle, Booking.com, Amazon, AMD, Facebook, Microsoft, Tesla, Zoom (I exited early) - last 10 years of investing. I need to calculate exact annualized returns, but it is definitely more than 20%.
6/29/20, 5:16 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: This is without daily tension of time actions or timing buy/sell.
6/29/20, 5:17 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: On average I held most stock for 2+ years.
6/29/20, 5:17 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Sorry forgot to mention Bitcoin. It is biggest of the monster.
6/29/20, 5:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Agree, but all companies get crushed when markets are falling, as happened in March. Need to know the bigger trend to opportunistically position yourself.
6/29/20, 5:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I agree
6/29/20, 5:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I hold it forever unless the narrative changes. Winners keep winning
6/29/20, 5:23 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: yes, market exits are tough.
6/29/20, 5:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Since we are talking about picking stocks, let me share my principles of investing. Feel free to use or implement for anyone who likes it.
6/29/20, 5:33 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Only invest in companies that have

1. Consistent history of sales, income and cash flow growth - "Consistency transforms average into excellence"

2. Have a history of crushing the market returns over multiple time period - "Winners keep winning"

3. Have built a moat to protect itself from competition "Think strong castle surrounded by water filled with Sharks"

4. Part of secular growth industry that have a huge addressable market "A rising tide will raise all boats"

5. Buy aggressively when there is blood on the street, sell during period of irrational exuberance or when story changes "Charts are reflection of human behaviour"

6. Visionary leader and quality management that have deep skin in the game "A brilliant jockey knows how to pick the winning horse"

7. Think long, really long term and let compounding work its magic. It is the 7th principle but 8th wonder of the world
6/29/20, 5:39 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: But. Everyone just struggle to find the right stock out of 1000s in the play keeping all the above in mind.
6/29/20, 5:43 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: yes, you can literally analyze 1000's of things about stock. Or just look at simple fact that I stated above. Look for companies with great product/services (highly rated by customer), check the adoption curve, Buy dips.
6/29/20, 5:43 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Three step process:
6/29/20, 5:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yes, there will always a few stocks that will meet the above criteria. You just have to scour through those by 1) understanding the bigger trend 2) scouring through Financials quarter over quarter 3) keeping an eye on the chart, as it will always tell the story. Keeping a tab on all of them is a full toke job.
6/29/20, 5:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: *time
6/29/20, 5:44 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: 1) Look for companies with mindblowing product/services (loved by customer)
6/29/20, 5:44 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: 2) Check the growth/adoption curve.
6/29/20, 5:44 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: 3) Buy dips.
6/29/20, 5:44 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Dont try to hold more than 5-6 stocks. That is good enough diversification.
6/29/20, 5:46 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Once you start investing in companies, love that company. Promote it. Buy its product. Wear its T-shirt.
6/29/20, 5:46 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Read everything about that company. Every news about it.
6/29/20, 5:46 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Troll the people who hate this company.
6/29/20, 5:46 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Troll the analyst who give underperform ratings.
6/29/20, 5:47 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Coordinate shitposting with other supporters against haters.
6/29/20, 5:48 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Start cancellation movement against haters.
6/29/20, 5:48 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Send emails to media professionals pushing them to write favorable pieces about company.
6/29/20, 5:50 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Above is called Activist investing strategy. I follow it. It earns great returns,, it is lot of fun,, you learn more than most serious investors. As you collide with haters everyday, you can also guage risks before it becomes market factored.
6/29/20, 5:58 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: I've seen in my experience that loving any company makes it much tougher to sell. I always remain silent about my companies. Only like no love policy helps review it more critically and no strings attached objective decision making
6/29/20, 6:00 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: You still love products and buy it. Just don't keep the stocks. When company is successful and has achieved it's potential, your love hardly matter. Better to give love and care to other product 😍
6/29/20, 6:00 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: To other stock*

6/30/20, 2:07 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I am not bullish on economy, earnings and valuation.
6/30/20, 2:07 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I am bullish on money printer.

6/30/20, 2:08 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Honestly, I believe, SP500 at 2700 is sweet spot for Trump presidency.

6/30/20, 2:36 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It will get resolved, one way or other. Either Fed stop pump $ (stock market crumbles) or keeps pumping ($ value get compromised for long which will lead to commodity inflation and stock market crumble).
6/30/20, 2:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The fed is just getting started. Its a few years to get to bubble

7/1/20, 1:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Lets look at the real news that people should focus when estimating the direction of the market. 

- Pfizer received positive results on its vaccine trial.   This is no mom and pop company and has always been conservative in its forecast. When they say, the medical community listens.

- US manufacturing PMI came above 50 which means its expanding not contracting. This is often the most leading economic indicator out there.

-  US private sector added 2.37mm jobs in June
7/1/20, 1:58 PM - +1 (773) 364-0061: oo. some positives news atleast.

7/1/20, 2:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The biggest risk to the market is another round of lock down due to spike in cases, but Trump will not let that happen given the elections. After the elections we might be closer to some sort of treatment or vaccine or the world will learn to live with it.
7/1/20, 2:19 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: After election some experts predicting big crash. Very similar 2008
7/1/20, 2:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Every year 'so called' experts predict crash. These fear mongers live on selling negative news or view, because it sells. Let's hear about some facts - 

- A market see 5-10% drawdown almost every year

- A 20% drawdown occurs every few

- 30%-50% drawdown is very uncommon and has happened only 10 in the last 90 years, so once every 9 years or so. Even looking at recent crashes, a 30%+ drawdown has happened 3 times in the last 20 years.
7/1/20, 2:34 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Anybody who is predicting a crash may be right but does not think in terms of probabilities.
7/1/20, 2:55 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Hmmm 🤔
7/1/20, 2:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Btw each of those crashes has been a great buying opportunity, and Mar-20 drawdown of 35% should be no different.

7/2/20, 2:07 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Today, 1st July, a new day for a new month, a new quarter - economically the transition quarter, second half of 2020 - make a new begining! The first half of 2020 was a washhout in many ways - social, business, economically, travel and outside services but it made us value family, good, hot & healthy meals and lack of commute and learning to work from home. Think of the non use of petroleum products due to no flights and local transportation and the positive effects on environment for us and our shared space co-inhabitants, the birds and the animals.

I know the second half will be scale up the downsides but let us not scale down the gains we have made!

7/6/20, 4:14 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: For car company, that is difficult. Growth of tesla is limited by production capacity. Tesla will have achieve 10m car by 2023. Current capacity is 0.5m cars per year.
7/6/20, 4:14 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: next 3 years, sorry.

Last 3 months everyday big Pundits are predicting market will fall market will fall. 1.5 Trillion Dollars waiting on the sidelines waiting for the market to fall. It will fall but just like any market correction. No market can keep going up. And it is not even healthy. Majority kept waiting with cash and market never gave them the chance.

7/7/20, 8:42 PM - +1 (781) 774-0196: I feel like they’ve sat on their cash for too long, and the 10B deal with Dominion is just the small one before the mega deal.
7/7/20, 8:47 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I think he lost his touch. Just buying up VOO and AAPL.
7/7/20, 9:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Asish, welcome. I added the below to this group sometime back on Warren Buffet. Hope that helps.
7/7/20, 9:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Great question, I think Warren has not been as effective as he was in the past. I respect the legend, but here are his mistakes 

1. Did not buy and adhere to his principle of being greedy when there was blood in the street in March.  Market was 35% down which was the average of all bear markets. The maximum market has fallen is roughly 50%. He should have bought at that time, because risk to the downside was limited vs the reward to the upside.

2. He sold airlines at the wrong time. Airlines are cyclical stock whose earnings will be depressed this year, but that was already factored on price, as most of them were trading 50-70% discount. Airlines have roared back since then.

3. He has underperformed the index over the last 10 years, because of his exposure to cyclical stocks (energy and airlines) and being underweight to tech stocks who are ruling the world. 

So yes, unfortunately I think he has missed the boat.
7/7/20, 9:25 PM - +1 (781) 774-0196: 👍 Totally agree with number 2
7/7/20, 9:43 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: He may have lost touch but his decision on airlines looks correct. Ex: AAL,DAL, LUV are all trading below Avg. price of Mar'20 despite S&P bouncing about 30% from Avg. Mar levels. What we saw in June is just a bounce from lows. U can see the same in charts on all longer timeframes
7/7/20, 10:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Two points. 

Short term - The news of him selling airlines came on May 2nd. All airlines gained 50%+ after that and then retraced, and are still trading above the May 2nd level. Unless you know his average selling price, I'd conclude selling at those levels as poor execution. 

Long term - Selling at those depressed levels  concludes that airlines will never see the passenger traffic they have seen in the past. Since both of us do not know the share prices of this sector on a longer term basis (in-line with his time horizon), it is inconclusive that his decision is correct. We will have to wait for that.
7/7/20, 11:01 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I am not trying to justify his acts as I don’t think I have that kind of caliber however, He seems to be speculative as per the market conditions at that time(corona virus at its peak and people scared to board flights, simple demand supply rule), he anticipated that no one is going to board an aircraft till it is of utmost criticality. 
His decision and anticipation was 100% accurate. He got beaten by the fact that someone(fed n trump) thought of buying junk garbage at a high price just to keep stock market intact which he or a common man couldn’t expect, and did lose opportunities initially.

As far as long term is concerned, his speculation is right, till a vaccine comes or this virus goes away, it is never going to see the passenger traffic of past, and we all know this. 
The way economy doesn’t reflect stock market, stock market doesn’t reflect economy too.  Currently, all the airports are deserted, I myself being a premium 1k member of united, going to close this year at around 10k , I think he was right about the airlines . He lost the opportunity is a different issue. Also, we know losing opportunity and losing money are two different things and later is the worst !!! Knowing him, I guess he will bounce back...

7/8/20, 3:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Lets review Zoom stock with the help of a chart. 

- There are three lines on the chart. The orange line can be used for short term trading. As long as its above that, the short term trend is up. The stock started this trend at $200 in early June and has gained 30% over the last 1 month.

- The red line is the 50 week moving average and this level has been tested 5 times, since stock has began its longer term uptrend since it was at $60, which was also my buying price. The red line is at $200, which further increases the importance of that number. As long as stock in a longer term uptrend, that level should hold, and could be used as buying opportunities 

- The third line is my conservative really long term estimate of the stock at $180 (white line). It should be aggressively bought at that level.
7/8/20, 4:07 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: That was sheer luck
7/8/20, 5:00 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: It might be in 30's by mid August when results come out.
7/8/20, 5:06 PM - +1 (781) 774-0196: I can’t say if it’s a good buy to long. But from my personal exp. it’s been a great stock to swing for me. I’ve been buying the dips on it and holding for a few days and selling for profits. In that sense, it’s been pretty useful and consistent if you get in at the right time.
7/8/20, 6:01 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: I had 95 calls. That too zoomed 900% (Sold). Also holding 100 Shares buy at 72
7/8/20, 6:23 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Wowww 👍🏻👏👏
7/8/20, 6:24 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Keep getting weekly money from @100 shares
7/8/20, 6:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Unfortunately, I did not follow my own principle of not selling winners until the story or chart changes and sold out early at 165 for 175% gain. Since then this keeps running away from me, waiting to buy this again when it reaches the above levels.

7/9/20, 7:09 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: I do not think they are competitor. Fsly is mostly CDN provides cloude delivery faster putting routers at the edge. Cloudflare focuses more on internet security, provides dns services in a faster way.

7/9/20, 9:35 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Tesla Inc appears on the verge of joining the S&P 500, a major accomplishment for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk that would unleash a flood of new demand for the electric car maker’s shares, which have already surged 500% over the past year.
Higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, announced last week, have analysts increasingly confident the company will show a profit in its quarterly report on July 22. That would mark Tesla’s first cumulative four-quarter profit, a key hurdle to be added to the S&P 500.
With a market capitalization of about $250 billion, Tesla would be among the most valuable companies ever added to the S&P 500, larger than 95% of the index’s existing components. It would have a major impact on investment funds that track the index.

At the end of day its a car company (it's resource and capital intensive, has  poor margins and high debt and it dilutes a lot of equity). As long as the tap is on with free money, there is nothing wrong with it. Its when the tap closes, you have a situation or drought that comes with it.

7/11/20, 4:27 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: You have to make some investment for some guidance in making decisions what to buy and when to buy. And more importantly when to sell.

7/11/20, 4:29 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: How useful is “motley fool”?
7/11/20, 4:29 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Any suggestion
7/11/20, 4:41 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: They are my bacon. All the best stock in my portfolio is all their recommendation. 1.5 years back. I kept holding. And paying me off big time. The one I ignored. Like TSLA giving me pain. In short for stocks ever I applied my mind or my fiiends advise or any WA or FB advise. I lost money or my money is stuck.
7/11/20, 4:41 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Ok

7/11/20, 4:42 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Ragingull is very aggressive but if one clicks all your money is back.
7/11/20, 4:44 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Honestly I kept loosing money till the point I outsourced my stock picking to professional instead of a friend coming with some magical ticker.
7/11/20, 4:50 PM - +1 (732) 799-8114: @sanjay Prasad is Robbooker good for options trading
7/11/20, 4:51 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: I had 1 month free subscription but I personally didn’t see any worth. Instead I am following stock analysis by CNBC, yahoo, Bloomberg and some YouTube channels. I am very new in US market and still learning.
7/11/20, 4:52 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: I am writing my own matrix with KPIs
7/11/20, 4:52 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Majority for Indian market
7/11/20, 4:55 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Free mey kyaa miltaa hai Manish. Free kaa maal free jaisaa hee hotaa hai. My returns are 100% plus just following Motely Fool from last 1.5 years. I have majority of its subscription. I pay around $2000 per annum.
7/11/20, 4:57 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Prabhu, iska matlab ye ho sakta hai ki hame Aabhi Aur time lagega sikhne and fool.com ko samajhne me..
7/11/20, 4:57 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: CNBC mey post fact bataataa. Jab stock gets everyone attention then the majority of the gains are gone. You have to catch them early.
7/11/20, 4:58 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Agreed
7/11/20, 4:58 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: You do not pay to do the research. You are buying the research. They say buy you buy. And sit tight.
7/11/20, 5:00 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: For ex FSLY they suggested at $18. I brought it. 200 shares. 200 long term option. ZM on 72. SPOT on 140. SHOP on 156.
7/11/20, 5:00 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: There are many like this.
7/11/20, 5:01 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: TSLA at 350. I ignored.
7/11/20, 5:02 PM - +1 (732) 799-8114: Sanjay Bhai you sold us Mootley Foo today , thanks for suggestion.
7/11/20, 5:03 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Great 👍
7/11/20, 5:03 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Also I have a subscription for investor business daily. Around 35 per month. For daily updates. I brought NVAX at $4. Based on what I read on IBD. It hit 104.

7/11/20, 5:06 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Actually it’s true !!
7/11/20, 5:06 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Unable to focus anywhere else
7/11/20, 5:06 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Risk manage to karnaa hee padegaa. You got to be defensive. But overly defensive cuts your return. Govt bonds are very low risk but return is also low.
7/11/20, 5:06 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: It’s so so broad area

7/11/20, 5:09 PM - +1 (732) 799-8114: Sanjay bhai check if this is what you are recommending
7/11/20, 5:09 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Makets sector type of security hedging etc makes it very broad. And on top of it it is pure emotion. Greed and fear driven. But I am also thinking of buying some AI services which can predict by crunhing lot of data and mixing some human elements to that.
7/11/20, 5:10 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: I started with this. Then when I made some profit the brougt rule breakers. Then later their Cloud discovery.
7/11/20, 5:11 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Anyone interested to share this subscription? After Sanjay’s recommendation I wanted to give one try.
7/11/20, 5:12 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: But it is for long term investment
7/11/20, 5:12 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
7/11/20, 5:12 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Read their guidelines.
7/11/20, 5:13 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: I am ok for 2-3 years
7/11/20, 5:13 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: They want you to hold it for the longer term.
7/11/20, 5:13 PM - +1 (732) 799-8114: @12488263513 I am in

7/11/20, 5:14 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Thanks Sanjay for your help here.
7/11/20, 5:14 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Sure Vaibhav
7/11/20, 5:14 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Also do your research on the advise. They are mostly technology centric. That saved me the Corona catastroph.

7/11/20, 5:17 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Research*
7/11/20, 5:17 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Actually that’s why I have started learning this by myself in research. I just don’t want to be in hurry
7/11/20, 5:18 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: But really thanks Sanjay for your help here.
7/11/20, 5:19 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Take your time. Some day you will become competitor of fool.com. everyone has to start somewhere
7/11/20, 5:24 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Morningstar paid subscription also good. I had it for some time but didn’t continue as I wasn’t getting enough time for research.
7/11/20, 5:32 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Good for mutuslfunds.

7/11/20, 6:57 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: No matter how good your stock picker is, you lose some and you gain. So you average out your net gains and compare with mutual funds performance. It saves lot of time, just invest in a good etf or fund and forget.

7/15/20, 5:42 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: BTC is anonymous
7/15/20, 5:42 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: BTC is unconfiscable
7/15/20, 5:42 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: BTC is truly deflationary currency
7/15/20, 5:42 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: BTC is digital
7/15/20, 5:42 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: BTC is global
7/15/20, 5:42 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: BTC is the future

7/15/20, 5:45 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Few will believe this tweet and send bitcoins
7/15/20, 5:46 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: :(
7/15/20, 5:47 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: Maybe _minority opinion_ but I have no sympathy for folks who send :)
7/15/20, 5:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: + a 100 other cryptocurrencies who have much more advanced features. BTC just had a first mover advantage, its the longest running block chain and has more awareness than anything else.
7/15/20, 5:47 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: I agree ☝️
7/15/20, 5:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Scammers want your money, they are not holding for its future, they will likely convert into dollars and bail out.

7/15/20, 5:51 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: Wow that’s a digital coup
7/15/20, 5:51 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Less likely in near future. Cool down periods for hack. Then he will scrmable it before converting to $. Because most $ conversion points are KYCed.
7/15/20, 5:51 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: Amazon, Apple, Uber, etc
7/15/20, 5:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There are many that are decentralized and are dying just because of lack of awareness.
7/15/20, 5:52 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Network effects usually accrue to one player,, internet has long tradition of winner takes it all.
7/15/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: People don't want 100 variant of same recipe, they are going with true and tested. Lots of work still need to be done on BTC, I think it will reach there but after multiple periods of boom and busts
7/15/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Currently in the boom phase till it lasts
7/15/20, 5:55 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes and no. Base layer is ready. 11 years, 0 hack, 100% uptime. Some work needed in layer 2. Lightening network is ready, but it's being tested and it will take time for people to trust it
7/15/20, 5:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not anymore, there are 100s of technology companies slicing and dicing the benefit of internet in numerous ways to their advantage
7/15/20, 5:56 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: 1000s at application layers,, not at protocol layers. Tcp/ip, BitTorrent, onions,,, literally 1000s of examples of winner takes it all.

$NVAX | #Novavax To Present Progress Of Vaccine Candidate On 21st July
Watch out
7/20/20, 8:51 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: One of my best performing stock in my portfolio. I brought it at $4. As a random buy. Last year had $2000 spare cash when I ran out of stock idea. Thought of buying some under $5 stock. NVAX was one among them. Sometimes random buys prove to be much better than fully researched stock.

7/21/20, 4:24 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Please don’t quote me if he is wrong this time though😁
7/21/20, 4:44 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: best analyst on Tesla. Doesnt always have to be right to be the best.

7/21/20, 5:23 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: Is anyone buying option Call on Tesla?

7/21/20, 5:24 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: if tesla posts profit somehow, it will likely get included in SP500. That will drive price above $2K
7/21/20, 5:26 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: Considering number of vehicles increased on the road in last few months along with so many upgrades to FSDs, I feel confident that it will post profit.
7/21/20, 5:30 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Hoping Tesla to cross 2k  🤞 😀

7/22/20, 4:53 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Waiting for gyan ganga from Elliot wave theory in 500 words.......
7/22/20, 5:04 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Offcourse I have more words, because I dont throw darts in the board, am generally accurate, and  I do not miss the entire rally getting pie on the face.
7/22/20, 5:05 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Well, I did miss the rally. I would have usually made 5x to sp500, I made 3x instead.
7/22/20, 5:07 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Tesla 300%; oil futures 1400%; silver options 450%; gold miners 120%, Bitcoin 80% return. This is what I did during rally
7/22/20, 5:08 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, I am cautious about investing in stocks with no underlying earnings and completely relient on money printing.
7/22/20, 5:08 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: My positions are inflation hedge. Tesla being exception.
7/22/20, 5:09 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Without bullshit of Elliot 🌊
7/22/20, 5:09 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You were selling tesla all the way. I know you bought options on USO, but those were struggling given the current price
7/22/20, 5:10 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, I bought 2400 Tesla stocks and I was sold 1900 by the time it reached $1200.
7/22/20, 5:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Why should I trust any of these? Saying and doing something is totally different.
7/22/20, 5:11 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Well, I am not going to share personal financials transactions. But all my calls were discussed on the group.
7/22/20, 5:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Thats a nice way to put who knows nothing about nothing
7/22/20, 5:11 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Tally up the timings.
7/22/20, 5:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Your call was 2200 s&p
7/22/20, 5:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ha
7/22/20, 5:11 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: What?? Find it?
7/22/20, 5:12 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I said August September,, if earnings don't keep up we will see stock market crumble to 2400 sp500
7/22/20, 5:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Really didn't you say a 30% decline when it was 3000
7/22/20, 5:12 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Na, it must be someone else
7/22/20, 5:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You can find yourself, I have better things to do
7/22/20, 5:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Offcouese and I said earnings look at forwadd valuation
7/22/20, 5:14 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yeah, same here. Keep posting your essays.
7/22/20, 5:14 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Always forward looking
7/22/20, 5:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I said this and it seems like EWT is working better than throwing darts on the board
7/22/20, 5:39 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Guys lets respect each other views. If one has different idea then fine. There are several other ppl in this group who can be benefited by your opinions. 
You both may not need each other's opinion but several others may need both of yours opinion.
So, let do best and stay positive.
7/22/20, 5:39 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Thanks all your suggestions. It really helps a lot.
7/22/20, 5:45 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I may disagree, but I respect Nash and his essays 🙂
7/22/20, 5:46 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I think next big thing for Tesla will be inclusion in sp500
7/22/20, 5:46 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: As mentioned in Tesla daily podcast, it can open up demand for millions of Tesla shares
7/22/20, 5:46 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Musk might even split the stock price.
7/22/20, 5:46 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Sorry, split the stock
7/22/20, 5:47 PM - +1 (845) 327-3733: TV
7/22/20, 5:47 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: It will be super if the stock will split.
7/22/20, 5:49 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: ??
7/22/20, 5:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Anand, As you must have seen, I did not start this. I like to be professional, but expect everyone to maintain the same standard with me.

7/22/20, 5:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: For the record and to be factual, here was a conversation on April 10th. S&P was 2800 at that time which brings it at 2000-2100 per your forecast.
7/22/20, 6:00 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I know. Hope all will maintain and respect everyone's view. 
You are also very good in analysis. I heard from other members also.
Keep the spirit sir 😊👍.
7/22/20, 6:13 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Theek hai,, mein ungli nahi karunga ab.
7/22/20, 6:38 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Rightly said. We need both opinion. Also a suggestion. Can we discuss anything but TSLA. how many times and how many ways we can skin the cat. And I am sure less than 5% in this group has TSLA stock.
7/22/20, 6:43 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: This message was deleted
7/22/20, 6:44 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: N&N Analyst
7/22/20, 6:44 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Why you deleted
7/22/20, 6:48 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Tesla is priced for perfection. If smallest of thing goes wrong, it will take off 10-20% easily. At current valuation, reasonable upsides are difficult to be expected. However, fed pump led fake money can make bubble out of anything.
7/22/20, 6:48 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Next big upside for Tesla will be it's ability to deliver on self driving technology.
7/22/20, 6:49 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Tats a cool name N & N analyst. Definitely a go from my side 👍
7/22/20, 6:49 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: With full level 5 self driving capabilities, it will open up huge upside potential. It will become as big or bigger than Amazon.
7/22/20, 6:50 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Tech differentiation led by electric architecture of car, design, other technologies has been priced in, in my opinion.
7/22/20, 6:51 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Self driving will be huge potential upside.
7/22/20, 6:55 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: I don’t think full self drive is possible for another couple of years(from my experience as I am using it). But every small improvement make it feel like something new about the car which  is keeping users loyal.
Elon may go for ride hailing before completing FSD which is also very big thing.
7/22/20, 6:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: At this time, I am not actively buying since everything under the sun has been pushed to the sky. That said, I am happy to disclose my positions as and when I come across interesting and high conviction ideas. The last major purchase was Livongo at $60, and I will add more if it retraces.
7/22/20, 6:59 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, agree with fsd. Ride hailing is commodity now with out fsd
7/22/20, 7:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Here is a summary
7/22/20, 7:03 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: 👍
7/22/20, 7:51 PM - +1 (773) 364-0061: anyone selling HD projector?

7/22/20, 10:26 PM - +1 (773) 364-0061: apke muh nein ghee shakkar
7/23/20, 9:13 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: So Tesla is not even crossing $1700
7/23/20, 9:13 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: and chances are high today it will go down.
7/23/20, 9:18 AM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Thodaa kamjor lag rahaa hai.
7/23/20, 9:19 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: yeah....ideally it should go atleast $100 up in pre market.
7/23/20, 9:45 AM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: If the price does not swing. Then option traders are roasted.
7/23/20, 9:49 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: it is already
7/23/20, 11:06 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
7/23/20, 11:06 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Tesla is still following my shorter term trend line, so there is nothing wrong with it at this time. 

However, as you could see the charts are extended from the longer term trend line which has been in place since $400. This combined with weakening momentum increases the risk of drawdown to my longer term levels during a market sell-off. To put it straight, risks are elevated, so trade carefully.
7/23/20, 11:08 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And yes, I dont throw darts on the board.
7/23/20, 11:09 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Ungli kisne ki?
7/23/20, 11:09 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Just presenting factual information
7/23/20, 11:10 AM - +1 (646) 468-5061: bhai ek alag group banalo fight karne ke liye ..😜
7/23/20, 11:11 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Honestly I don't know what Tesla will trade at. Stock valuation has been disconnected from fundamentals since long.
7/23/20, 11:11 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ok, so why do you predict?
7/23/20, 11:11 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: $1800 was gut call based on crazy euphoria surrounding Tesla.
7/23/20, 11:12 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I am really good at predicting stock prices.
7/23/20, 11:12 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Same as 2100 for the s&p
7/23/20, 11:12 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I agree
7/23/20, 11:12 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 😉
7/23/20, 11:13 AM - +1 (646) 468-5061: bhai 12 baje kya price rahega tesla ka
7/23/20, 11:13 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ha ha
7/23/20, 11:13 AM - +1 (646) 468-5061: 🤪
7/23/20, 11:13 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: lol
7/23/20, 11:14 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: If I was 100% sure of price at noon, I would be billionaire and won't even if talking here
7/23/20, 11:14 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: This message was deleted
7/23/20, 11:14 AM - +1 (646) 468-5061: then why the hell are you saying that you are good at predicting price
7/23/20, 11:14 AM - +1 (646) 468-5061: why making people fool .. better leave the group
7/23/20, 11:15 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Tesla has some pending news that could pump stock up to $1800, 1) sp500 inclusion 2) battery day announcements
7/23/20, 11:15 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: You are a idiot.
7/23/20, 11:16 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Wait for those two news it might revisit new Hughes.
7/23/20, 11:16 AM - +1 (646) 468-5061: really .. all knows in this group who is an idiot .. i have no knowledge abt stock however dont misguide people
7/23/20, 11:16 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Highes
7/23/20, 11:17 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Any one who is serious in investing knows that no one gets everything correct. One is often wrong.
7/23/20, 11:17 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It's just trades you take that makes you good returns.
7/23/20, 11:18 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I pick my trades when odds are looking very favorable or probability based. I get lots of them right. I do get some wrong, in which case I follow disciplined stop losses.
7/23/20, 11:19 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I just look at probabilities, I think Tesla stock has momentum. Next quarter results will be okayish. But it has two big news pending.
7/23/20, 11:20 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Fundamentally Tesla should be $750; but fundamentals have been burned to ground by fed reserve.
7/23/20, 11:21 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: While you trade Tesla on pending news, please be careful.
7/23/20, 11:22 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Tesla is extremely expensive and might crash anytime.
7/23/20, 11:23 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Btw, I love Tesla. I will buy every share of Tesla if it ever goes under $800.
7/23/20, 11:23 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: At this price, I have other better safer bets to make.
7/23/20, 11:25 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: <Media omitted>
7/23/20, 11:25 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: This is just 1 year performance.
7/23/20, 11:26 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: When some idiots say I missed rally,, dude I killed rally. And killed it with safe high probability picks.
7/23/20, 11:27 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Most performance after crash is driven by inflation hedge assets and Tesla.
7/23/20, 11:29 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I am still selling Tesla. I have 200 more to sell. I am looking for $1800 on those two news. If not I will sell at $1450 and move my capital to other stocks.
7/23/20, 11:34 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: If you analyze Tesla earnings yesterday, it was mostly driven by regulatory credits.
7/23/20, 11:34 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: If not for credits, Tesla would have made loss of $200m.
7/23/20, 11:35 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: In second half of the year, Tesla won't get benefit of regulatory credits.
7/23/20, 11:35 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 👍🏻
7/23/20, 11:35 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Q3 & Q4 will be driven by real performance.
7/23/20, 11:35 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Car sales.
7/23/20, 11:36 AM - +1 (201) 736-9742: Right on point 👌
7/23/20, 11:37 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: And the income from these credits is not a long term strategy
7/23/20, 11:38 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, reason analyst are so off with Tesla earnings estimate. It's difficult not predict account receivables and when credits hit
7/23/20, 11:39 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Overall car sales are down 30%, sooner or later macro trend in auto industry will catch up with Tesla.
7/23/20, 11:40 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Buy Tesla at this price for anything more than week is taking huge risk.
7/23/20, 11:42 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I hope sp500 doesn't bring up regulatory credits accounting to keep Tesla out. I don't have much context related to sp500 inclusion.
7/23/20, 11:48 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Gold about to touch 1900$
7/23/20, 11:48 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: All time high is probably, $1930.
7/23/20, 11:49 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Gold miners are heavily discounted compared to gold price.
7/23/20, 11:50 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I bought gdxj around $30 and gdx at $28.
7/23/20, 11:50 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Currently, gdx is at $42, but still heavily discounted against gold price.
7/23/20, 11:50 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Gdx should be trading at $55 if gold price sustains around $1900 or above.
7/23/20, 11:56 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Anyone who says Niraj Patel is not good with stocks is crazy and doesnt know about stocks himself. Anyone who says that about Nash is also crazy. They both are terrific at what they do. Although they both have very different set of skillsets. But guess what it works for them. And try to learn from them. If you think you're a bigger expert good luck to you. These are the two people I look forward to hearing from on this group.
7/23/20, 11:57 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: And does anyone know what happened to Rajesh Kumar? He used to comment a lot on this group and he was good too. Haven't seen him here in months.
7/23/20, 11:57 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Where is Rajesh Kumar?
7/23/20, 11:58 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Is this the same guy @919810484684 ?
7/23/20, 11:58 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Probably
7/23/20, 12:27 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: 👍🏻🙏🏻
7/23/20, 12:28 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: I agree. Good discussion. I love understanding point of views from both of them. Lucky to have both of you in this group and learn from you
7/23/20, 12:31 PM - +1 (732) 986-0073: 👍👏👏
7/23/20, 12:31 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Agree.. its an amazing mix of fundamentals and gut feel. I love to hear from both 👍
7/23/20, 12:35 PM - +1 (732) 986-0073: Find your own broker, do not get guided or misguided here, use you sence to make it sence , otherwise it becomes nonsense
7/23/20, 12:35 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Airlines stocks up!! United flying despite earning loss!!

7/23/20, 12:39 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Expectations that United will fire thousands of employees
7/23/20, 12:40 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: <Media omitted>
7/23/20, 12:41 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: I agree. Both are a great asset to this group. Sometimes I am amazed by the details they go into. They really know where they are parking the money.
7/23/20, 12:48 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: 👍👍👍
7/23/20, 12:48 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: That’s right
7/23/20, 12:51 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Sanjay Sahab,  I am also learning from you.
7/23/20, 12:53 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: I don't know what value I am adding to the group. 😀😀
7/23/20, 12:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Good chart, but my observation is consumer and covid sensitive sectors in total form a very small part of the S&P (energy, airlines, retail, leisure etc adds up to less than 15%). The big transformation and growth is happening in healthcare and technology which has found its longer term tailwinds and have performed really well and they by the way have been powering the market forward (along with cheap money). Obviously these are extended too, but any pullback will likely be bought.

Point being - A significant portion of performance comes being in the right sector. The price for some stocks looks cheap for a reason.
7/23/20, 1:04 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Bade logo ko ye pata nhi chalta 😃
7/23/20, 1:05 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: OPKO is on fire 🔥

7/23/20, 1:25 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: one of analyst first set the target for $12
7/23/20, 1:25 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: thats is double
7/23/20, 1:25 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: 👌🏻👌🏻👍🏻👍🏻
7/23/20, 1:26 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Jai mata di bol kr laga diye hai.. dekhte hai :)
7/23/20, 1:27 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Moderna to 1 din ki chandani ke bad gayab hi ho gai, US ne testing band kar diya kya ?
7/23/20, 1:27 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Wo chandi is moved to Pfizer

7/23/20, 1:36 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Bitcoin finally breaks correlation with sp500
7/23/20, 1:45 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: What does this mean?
7/23/20, 1:46 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Sp500 moves were leading movements in bitcoin. Sp up, BTC up,, sp down, BTC down.
7/23/20, 1:46 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: After 2 months, BTC is up why sp is down.
7/23/20, 1:58 PM - +1 (773) 364-0061: tesla ka to aache se lag gaya
7/23/20, 1:58 PM - +1 (773) 364-0061: yaha se niche jayega aab tesla
7/23/20, 2:07 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: yes, we just have to see how much of it is overall market driven vs tesla solo
7/23/20, 2:07 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Do you have any technical basis or fundamentals
7/23/20, 2:07 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: we need to see when BTC goes alomg with s&p and detaches - i guess
7/23/20, 2:08 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Nasdaq 240 points down !!! Huge!!
7/23/20, 2:08 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: yes, today it did disconnect. But we have to see week closing before we can bury correlation
7/23/20, 2:10 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: agreed
7/23/20, 2:29 PM - +91 98104 84684: May be the one you are talking is different Rajesh.
I am a new member in this group in learning mode 😊🙏
7/23/20, 2:48 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Bhai ne pahle hi hath khada kr diya, mai naya hu mujhe mat pakdo 😃😃
7/23/20, 2:49 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Jha ji, aapki kahani hai ya fir koi research ?
7/23/20, 2:49 PM - +1 (773) 364-0061: my guess only.
7/23/20, 2:49 PM - +1 (773) 364-0061: :)
7/23/20, 2:54 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: then it’s fine. 😂
7/23/20, 2:54 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Research hote then tension tha
7/23/20, 2:54 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It is because of the unemployment report- 30 MN people are taking jobless claims. Fed must be out of ink ... they might change the cartridge soon though😜
7/23/20, 2:55 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: They have to decide by 31st I guess before parliament will go off
7/23/20, 3:02 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: BTC is play against the dollar which complements risk assets. While correlation may vary from week to week or even months, it is inconclusive to say that the longer term trend is broken. During a market crash, everyone needs the cover including folks who trade both btc and stocks.
7/23/20, 3:02 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
7/23/20, 3:03 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Buy recommendation?
7/23/20, 3:04 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It's play against the dollar. But it's goes with dollar supply. Increase dollar supply is favorable for BTC price. Covid crash was liquidity squeeze, almost every safe haven asset corrected with equities.
7/23/20, 3:05 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: BTC has been strongly correlated with sp500 lately. So much so that every uptick and downtick was religiously followed.
7/23/20, 3:06 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It is inconclusive to say it is broken based on 4-5 hours of price movement.
7/23/20, 3:07 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: If it does so remains for a week, it is conclusive for me that we are seeing some disconnect
7/23/20, 3:09 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not a good enough time frame for me. In other words, I dont want to hold btc when stocks crash 20% (though not expecting that), its higher beta and will have a wider magnitude of swings one can imagine
7/23/20, 3:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: For eg in the mosy recent crash, s&p went down 35%, btc was down more than 60%
7/23/20, 3:14 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: yes, BTC is 170b asset. its going to sway more. Is that even point to debate?
7/23/20, 3:16 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: btc is also up 120% from crash lows. Is sp500 up so much? Implied vol of BTC is much higher. It was always known before covid or right now.
7/23/20, 3:19 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: <Media omitted>
7/23/20, 3:20 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Just feel bad for all the options trader who were betting on TSLA earnings. No side won.
7/23/20, 3:34 PM - +1 (609) 216-4502: does anyone recommend Zacks or has any feedback abt them?

7/23/20, 3:54 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: If u miss mrna, get on to abus
7/23/20, 4:09 PM - +1 (917) 578-2068: What does that mean in layman terms?
7/23/20, 4:25 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: That puts it right around the fortune 25 companies like at&t and pfizer which obviously are more stable. Just bcoz btc is 170bn its lame to think it will sway more. Not a valid argument. 

On your other commenting, Its IV is higher because its an emerging asset class and driven more by sentiments and technicals.
7/23/20, 4:40 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It's just so insane to compare volatility of monetary asset to incorporation (driven by operating asset). I am not surprised you did that.
7/23/20, 4:40 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Compare volatility with other safe havens.
7/23/20, 4:40 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Let's see gold.
7/23/20, 4:41 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: With approx market cap of $10 trillion, it took 20% dip during crash.
7/23/20, 4:41 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: BTC is 2% the size of gold. Emerging asset with lot of concerns yet to be settled.
7/23/20, 4:42 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: We will see higher volatility till it grows into $1t asset
7/23/20, 4:44 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Short sellers had sold 26m Tesla stocks year ago, when Tesla stock price went up, their losses increased, and they closed their trades by buying at higher price. We are still 12m stocks short. I don't know what natural level of short interest is,, but 12m stock on short is high as well
7/23/20, 4:48 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Just so that I am transparent. I love Bitcoin. Not only I invest in. I also spend time time and resources in its core development and infrastructure.
7/23/20, 4:49 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: So my buying BTC is for love more than investment returns
7/23/20, 4:49 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I hate fed money printing. I think it is the biggest evil of our time.
7/23/20, 4:49 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Today i signed up for pi
7/23/20, 4:50 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Fed or RBI gives huge power to politicians,, and politicians use it to persecute opposition, dissent and segments.
7/23/20, 4:50 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It's ideological.
7/23/20, 4:54 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: <Media omitted>
7/23/20, 4:54 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Strict adherence to gold standard is also not good. So printing should be a balanced act, in my opinion.
7/23/20, 4:54 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: This message was deleted
7/23/20, 4:55 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Which politician won't print his way out given opportunity
7/23/20, 4:58 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Agreed. It shouldn’t be a political tool. There is no politician who looks for greater / longer term good.

7/23/20, 5:39 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Who funds the fiscal deficit?
7/23/20, 5:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They borrow from people like you and me and institutions
7/23/20, 5:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Monetary and Federal policy have different governance structure
7/23/20, 5:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Thats why you need seprraye branches yo maintain check and balances

7/23/20, 5:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I understand ded buy government debt, doesn't mean it will monetize those
7/23/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: *Fed
7/23/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Look at $4.2T on asset side are fed treasury bills.
7/23/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Hahahaha
7/23/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: In other words government has to pay it back
7/23/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: From taxes of people like you an me
7/23/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Every 55 cents of $1 that us government spends comes from debt now.
7/23/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: You really think us government will pay this debt?
7/23/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Nothing new, the debt has been increasing foeever
7/23/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: When?? Do you what tax rate will be?
7/23/20, 5:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Doesn't mean, Fed is influenced by politicians
7/23/20, 5:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Thats a factually incorrect statement
7/23/20, 5:55 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: 🙏 I rest my argument here. You accepted but are too egoist to accept your incorrect understanding.
7/23/20, 5:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: How is my understanding incorrect. The Fed mandate is to balance unemployment, inflation and growth and is governed by that. Juay bcoz government wants cheap money, does not in any way dictate how fed influences its policy.
7/23/20, 5:58 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes fed has a mandate to stabilize the economy. It does that using 3 main weapons - lowering interest rates, funding government deficit, and creating stabilization fund.
7/23/20, 5:58 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: While doing above, fed has to make sure inflation targets are met.
7/23/20, 5:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: But how are politicians influencing its policy
7/23/20, 5:59 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Buy appointment of lackneys to federal board
7/23/20, 5:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Everything is a conspiracy theory
7/23/20, 5:59 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Just like Judy Shelton is to be appointed next
7/23/20, 5:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There is reason why Trump could not influence Powell and resulted in big conflict of interest
7/23/20, 6:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
7/23/20, 6:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You need a lot of explantion
7/23/20, 6:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Anyways, I am done for today
7/23/20, 6:01 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Check how they are appointed. Last year chris waller and Judy Shelton were appointed by Trump to fed reserve.
7/23/20, 6:03 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: President influences fed voting by appointments. Once appointed, president needs extraordinary circumstances to fire fed board member. But he can. Ofcourse, it can be challenged in supreme court.
7/23/20, 6:03 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Never happened before
7/23/20, 6:04 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not for not agreeing to the policy enforced by the chair
7/23/20, 6:05 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Never said it happened. Not for policy, but for any impropriety. President doesn't need to fire fed chair. He just appoints right people onto board, his job is mostly done.
7/23/20, 6:06 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: President just needs fed to keep interest low and buy treasury bonds. I have rarely seen fed ever challenge that.
7/23/20, 6:06 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I am aghast at how shallow your understanding is. Anyways, I am happy you are learning.
7/23/20, 6:08 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Now you are talking about malignin intent of the President, which is beyond our knowledge. There are set of criteria that a president needs to look for fed chair, not bcoz he will/will not agree to him. Its an independent body with independent mandare. Period
7/23/20, 6:08 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Mandate

7/23/20, 6:09 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Interest rates are low, bcoz US is unable to pick up inflation, bcoz productivity has been declining with the country becoming more matured, because there is unlimited dry powder that needs safety, not because president says so.
7/23/20, 6:10 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: For anyone who wants good grasp of fed reserve inner workings. Very process, tool, personnel, duty and responsibilities explained.
7/23/20, 6:11 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Productivity is increasing, which is driving price deflation. Helping keep consumer inflation low.
7/23/20, 6:12 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: CPI is but limited metric, I prefer looking at cost of living (includes healthcare, education and financial assets)
7/23/20, 6:12 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Bhai, you should ask for refund if you ever paid someone to teach you economics and finance.

7/23/20, 6:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You cannot look at year over year change, thats lame, because population has a factor to play with higher productivity growth, you need to look at the change keeping population and other technological factors constant.
7/23/20, 6:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I will send you book to read more about it when I have time.
7/23/20, 6:22 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Why should I keep technology factors constant? I understand controlling for population
7/23/20, 6:23 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I can't discuss this anymore. Gtg
7/23/20, 6:23 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Good night. Don't forget to ask for refund.
7/23/20, 6:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: May be the politicians will issue you a refund from free money.

7/24/20, 10:15 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, fed will try it's best to pump. Trump may also pitch in with tax reliefs.
7/24/20, 10:15 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Don't know what he can get through congress, but some tax reliefs will come as well.
7/24/20, 10:16 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Democrats are now holding fiscal measures hostage to get new York City funded by federal government.
7/24/20, 10:17 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Don't expect sudden drops,, we will crumble over next 6 months.
7/24/20, 10:17 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Stats - Annual returns for markets have never been negative in an election year. If history is a guide, we will end s&p above 3200 for year end. Offcourse in between there can be whipsaws
7/24/20, 10:19 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: After 3rd Nov, money printing will slowdown and will become more responsible. So position with that in mind.

7/24/20, 10:26 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: While you play Tesla on momentum, just keep in mind no credits coming next two quarters. Also, Elon musk on record saying Tesla to operate on lower margins to gain market share. So it pushes away earnings some years down the line.
7/24/20, 10:33 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Ok....I'll keep on Averaging.

7/24/20, 11:34 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I misspoke. When a president is up for re-election which is the case today and not in 2008, stocks are up 100% of the time with quite attractive returns since 1960
7/24/20, 11:34 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 1950
7/24/20, 11:37 AM - +1 (609) 216-4502: Good save :) , but I cannot see how Trump can win or how Biden's 28% corp tax can make s&p go all time high
7/24/20, 11:40 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: You have to look at battleground states only. If you live in cali or ny, you will feel like Trump is worst president. But talk with someone in midwest, he is the hero.
7/24/20, 11:42 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Biden is leading in polls, but polls have been significantly off in previous elections, most notably last one. 

Again, s&p does not have to go all time high, remain at this level for it to be a positive year. We'll see, either way we will learn more.

7/27/20, 9:46 PM - +1 (419) 215-2329: Experts, Please advice.
1 Robinhood, TDAmeritrade will deduct withholding tax on sale of stocks or options?
2. If no, we have to pay tax now or else can we pay tax at the time of filing tax return. 
3. Is there any way we can check whether we got gain or loss on sale instead of manual comparison?
7/27/20, 9:57 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Option 2. You get a tax statement at the end of year from brokerage firm Form 1099-B which has the profit or loss for the year. In TD - go to my account - cost basis. This should give an idea about the adj gain for the transactions in a year.  One of the useful options i recently learned was Tax lot - FIFO, LIFO etc. in TD. Usually the default is FIFO but you can adjust this based on your goals and how you want to tax your proceeds since short term capital gain is taxed at your ordinary tax rate but long term (>1 year) is usually subject to less taxes.

Starbucks have dropped

Its still 200x from its IPO vs S&P 7x gain. 

Its a high quality stable business, and covid-19 is only a speed bump from where it sits.

7/28/20, 11:58 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: TSLA is 17 year old company. TSLA's very big part of business is Batteries. And the stock is over priced for perfection. NKLA is based on the future technology and way better than avg millage.  Still TSLA car owners do not go for long drives in their car. I mean 4-5+ hours of drive.

7/30/20, 9:08 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not worried about GDP, its built in the price. For companies that have reported earnings roughly 70-80% have either delivered a positive revenue or eps surprise, part of which because the expectation coming in the quarter was so low. More than earnings, the valuations have been stretched, so was not expecting any big bang by the market but being in the range. Market rightly has been moving sideways since early June.

Please note this is an early stage medtech company, and have above average risk profile. It will also take some time for it to realize its full potential.  See summary below

7/30/20, 6:41 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Yeah .. looks like a good strategy to attract investors . Wonder y not all companies do it. Amazon - 3200$ . Any expert comments ?
7/30/20, 6:43 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I doubt this, especially because some brokers are offering the ability to buy fractional shares.
7/30/20, 6:43 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Not sure of RH though
7/30/20, 6:43 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Difference would be dividend between fractional share worth 100$ and 1 stock worth $100
7/30/20, 6:46 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: My understanding is, dividend is given per share. If $0.6 per share is dividend earlier, now it will become $0.15 per share. So it doesn’t matter either way.

7/30/20, 7:20 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Yes RH does offee fractional shares

7/30/20, 7:46 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: There are couple more. If you have patience. GH EXAS BLUE.
7/30/20, 7:48 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: But sold all of them. Cannot just do buy and wait. I held them for over the year. But they were like very tortoise type. But someday they will explode. I have that hunch.

7/30/20, 8:44 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: So should we buy now or wait till it split and the share price reduces to 90
7/30/20, 8:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah, I like to own for really long term, so I typically like to buy turtles when no one is looking at it, and wait for it run beyond imaginations. Today it broke some resistances, will need to wait and see if we got enough fire power to go back to all time high and beyond.
7/30/20, 9:10 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Can’t say which one is better. It’s all about market ups and downs.
7/30/20, 9:36 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: AAL is around $11 while United, Delta, Southwest are hovering between $25 and $35. 
I would think AA has similar financial stats as others but   does AAL have chance to catch up to prices of others?
7/30/20, 10:31 PM - +1 (732) 986-0073: AAL  and Delta has the biggest fleet in US.  It is about time AAL may bounce , when we get that news people can travel.
7/30/20, 10:44 PM - +1 (419) 215-2329: RH is also allowing to buy partial shares. It is only on invitation basis as of now.
7/30/20, 11:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: AAL lost a billion dollar in the quarter.  They have $4bn in cash, but roughly the same amount coming outstanding in debt this year. Over and above that they have $20bn in long term debt. That's a lot of debt for a $6bn company.  

There is a reason why the stock is 1/3rd of other airlines. The assumption here is they will either keep borrowing to cover their losses, dilute a lot of shares or trump will bail them out. However if you do not get a vaccine or elections goes to Biden, there is a risk, they will belly up. Its a high risk stock and in a downtrend. Offcourse if things work, they will go up, but you need to acknowledge the risks.
7/30/20, 11:42 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Thanks. So you're saying United doesn't have as much losses and debts. Interesting

7/31/20, 6:53 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I have not see others, but my understanding is Southwest has a pristine balance sheet, and Delta is the top dog. 

Investing in airlines is all about balance sheet (since there is minimal revenue) analysis and whether they will be able to withstand of downturn is extended.

7/31/20, 11:37 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: As per my understanding,  for that one needs to be i140 approved....  I am still on h1b,,

8/1/20, 9:10 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Bitcoin had the 2nd highest monthly close ever. 

Its getting started in its bull market.
8/1/20, 9:26 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Since we have record revenue from spot, shop, pins etc, one thing to remember all of them are users of fastly. And as fastly bills on data usage, it means a surge for their edge computing product. 

I cannot speculate on how they will do on their price action post results, but it seems they will have a great quarter. Its a great long term stock with Net. 

Long fastly since $15
8/1/20, 9:34 AM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: These are my thoughts as well. But sometimes price action post earnings are totally opposite. No set pattern.
8/1/20, 9:37 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah, If you are in a long game (not trading), price action post results doesn't matter in the big scheme of things. Staying invested as long as the business is performing, price action will follow.
8/1/20, 9:53 AM - +1 (551) 580-3181: if most recent tax filing is jointly then both should have SSN
8/1/20, 10:21 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 👍🏻
8/1/20, 11:04 AM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: I have a hybrid strategy. First I had just long term portfolio. Only thing I did was just sit and watch. Then I converted 40% of my portfolio to long term options ((1 year +) with the same underlying security. Then I got some amplified action. Since got more stocks at the same investment Then took some profit to buy short term options of the same proven stocks. (3 moths). Keep it handy to sell anytime it reaches my decipline like 100% increase. And then I keep some fun money to play around with weekly options. Just for the heck of it. So that I do mot have to make a trip to Atlantic City for some excitement. 
So for Example. I have 200 FSLY stock at 26 and 2 contract of option expiring Jan 2022 at strike of $23. Then I have 2 strike of 95 expiring Jan 2021. And 4 contracts at strike of 95 expiring Aug 21. So closely following. 4 of them Aug 21 are in hit and miss zone. Yaa a hit zone. Will see.
8/1/20, 12:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I have been in the market for around 15 odd years and believe me, I have done everything under the sun (and also have got burnt many times). This has taught me the importance to do anything and everything that works for you, and not do things that does not (this will differ from person to person)

I wish you luck with your endeavor.
8/1/20, 12:09 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: I take my losses as a Tution Fee to learn and adapt.

8/1/20, 1:06 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: I think it might be helpful if some of the key players here like Nash, Niraj, Sanjay, Rajesh etc. can share when they buy or sell stocks along with the reasoning behind it. This will help everyone not only to learn but also we can follow you (and not wait for learn, take right calls and avoid/minimize mistakes)... I understand ultimately it's individual's risk and call whether to follow or not.... Just a thought 🙏🏻

8/1/20, 2:03 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I positioned myself in btc during first dip to $3300 during 2018 end. And added more to hold position when it corrected in March. This addition was done at $4800. So I am not actively buying right now. However, I am not selling before $20k. Some position I plan to hold for 5 years.
8/1/20, 2:09 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Only one caveat, if stock market corrects for some reason we might see BTC dip to $7.5k levels. But it seems fed and government are hell bent on keeping that balloon proped up.

Long term wash sale, reverse splits 4 year back.
Current gain + long term wash added as gains in current. 
Can we harvest loss again and how ,if possible
8/1/20, 2:54 PM - +1 (201) 838-3517: Not exactly harvest loss...but balance off towards any anticipated losses.
8/1/20, 2:56 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Bhai ye group mey koi loss mey nahi hai

8/1/20, 3:01 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: other case could be btc detaching completely from s&p
8/1/20, 3:02 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Well, it depends on scenario background to market crash. But I wish it becomes uncorrelated.

8/1/20, 4:26 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I have tried to discuss high conviction ideas in the past and will continue to do in the future (talked about roku, livango, bitcoin, fastly, cloudfare, shopify etc) 

Most of my investments are existing longer term buy and hold, and I continue to reinvest in them whenever market tanks, so my average price in most cases will be much lower. I am very selective in buying anything now, given how extended the markets are.  Give me a 10-20% pullback and I will start getting active again. 

My most recent buy is Sea limited at slightly over $100, when the nasdaq tanked last week. I always buy 1/3rd, so I want the stock to go down to buy more (expectation of $80-$90), but unfortunately it shot up 20% since then. The charts are extended and I always recommend folks to only buy during a pullback.

8/2/20, 4:40 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: AstraZeneca is one of the 25 pharmaceutical companies across the world, testing experimental drugs that could be used to combat the deadly virus. And, of course, if testing yields positive results, AstraZeneca could manufacture hundreds of millions of doses, with no legal recourse if side effects are seen.

European officials told Reuters that product liability was a significant discussion to secure new vaccine drugs from Pfizer, Sanofi, and Johnson & Johnson.

As for the US, well, when it comes to the legal framework around vaccines, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) already has a law called the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, which provides immunity to vaccine companies if something goes wrong.

With AstraZeneca, and many US big pharma companies rushing COVID-19 vaccines to market with governments granting them immunity if the vaccine has side effects, all suggest corporate elites and government regulators have very little faith in these drugs.

And if something is giving profit,  then again wanna hold it..

8/3/20, 1:55 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: There is small minority of people holding onto those thesis.
8/3/20, 1:56 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I wait till the thesis gets widely accepted and mainstream,, at which point I sell and move on to next thing.

8/3/20, 2:00 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: usually when I sell,, there is insane mania going on,,, and valuations are usually widely disconnected from fundamental. For risk management of downside, I use trailing stop loss wider than 1 month implied volatility.

8/3/20, 3:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not a silly question, even professional money managers have difficulty in answering this. Let me give a try.

The first question you need to ask yourself is whether you are a trader or an investor. 

Traders get in an out of small profits, they don't care about business, valuation, fundamentals and  keep a  tight stop loss. 

There are also swing and position traders who hold for longer periods and are trend followers. 

And then there are investors, who behave like owners of the business, keep a tab on all activity of the business and hold for longer period until they think the return from their stock will be below their expected return. For eg, your return threshold is 15%/anum, as long as you think your stock may be able to beat that over long period of time, you shouldn't sell. 

I dont sell until the thesis of underlying business changes or if I am able to find an idea which is better than the one in my portfolio.

 Obviouly I sell portions to book profit, when I find the stock has gone up ridiculously in short amount of time  and raise cash, but the risk to that is the stock can keep going up. Case in point is - I got in zoom at $60, sold at $165, and since then kicking myself for selling the entire position. I should have sold half or 1/3rd and recover my cost basis, because the business thesis hasn't changed.

8/4/20, 6:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not only Oled materials is aesthetically superior than traditional LCDs,  but have better performance, more vivid colors, thinner and have better contrast ratios. From numerous TV producers to latest smartphones and smart watches to AR/VR devices, the world is converting to OLED's. The company has a large patent portfolio and makes money through licensing its technology and material sales, and may be a beneficiary when the world has an insatiable need for more devices, particularly in a 5G world. 

I used to own this stock but I don't any more given I have better ideas. That said i think the company is well positioned for many years to come and will do much better than the overall market.
8/4/20, 9:30 PM - +1 (347) 439-8391: Thank you 🙏 Nash! I had purchased a few of them, the price was not moving for some time but now it started picking up so wasn’t sure until when should they be held.
8/4/20, 9:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If nothing happens with the market, higher prices are likely ahead. 

- The stock is an uptrend and seems like its breaking out with higher volumes. 

- Oppenheimer recently came out with $210 price target noting no competitive pressure. 

- The new upcoming 5G iPhone is likely going to be using OLED, so there will be massive tailwind for the stock in times to come. 

- The eps estimates are coming down, and company has the history of beating estimates most of the time. I like Apple has crushed estimates. Since Apple uses OLED, it should be beneficial to OLED

- It is also work from home play, as people may have bought other  devices (laptops, pcs, tvs) as they transition their work to home. 

Overall, there are many reasons to like it. Just keep an eye on the overall market.

8/5/20, 7:57 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Beaten both rev and eps estimates today.

Revenue growth of 125%

Merging with Teladoc, which is a leader in telehealth market (also in my portfolio). Estimate to have $100mm in synergies. 

Up 150% from $60 price in couple of months.

No change in assessment, still consider as a multibagger
8/5/20, 8:55 AM - +1 (732) 956-6246: Hi.. what's your view on Moderna, can we buy?
8/5/20, 10:10 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Any clue why teladoc is going down post acquiring Livango, I think it’s a good buy and the stock should have rallied but it’s going down instead 😒
8/5/20, 10:12 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Both are down today 5%+ since the merger news came out
8/5/20, 10:12 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: *10%+
8/5/20, 10:27 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Not sure if anyone follows MTCH here. But they posted stellar earnings yesterday and is up 11% today
8/5/20, 11:20 AM - +1 (213) 568-8440: Is NVAX  good option to purchase now ???
8/5/20, 11:22 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Markets are generally skeptical of M&A, and seems to be an initial reaction. I think they make a good pair and complement in each other. The total addresable market significantly increases upon a combination. 

Also, as a long term holder, I typically not care much about day to day movement.
8/5/20, 11:23 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I follow it and own a small position
8/5/20, 11:26 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: They almost seem to have monopoly in their domain and appear well positioned to give good returns in long run.. I also have a small position and I am wondering if I should top it up.

What is your take on it ?
8/5/20, 11:30 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah absolutely a monopoly, they were under pressure as FB announced dating services, but it doesn't as a model worl for FB as it does for Match (because people want to have friend and relationship seperate). 

As for topping up, typically I always add on a pullback when the market  is hating it. It obviously can go higher being at all time high, but the odds of pullback also increases upon a market turn.
8/5/20, 11:31 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I would love to add this around $90-$95
8/5/20, 11:31 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: But it may not reach ther or may take time

8/5/20, 12:12 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad:  ￼ UPDATE
Aug 05, 2020
Huge Merger of Our Companies Cements the
Leader in Telehealth
Hi Sanjay,
A major deal in the healthcare sector was announced this morning involving two of my favorite companies. Teladoc Health (TDOC) and Livongo Health (LVGO) will merge in a cash and stock deal that values the new company at $18.5 billion.
Both stocks have been huge winners for our subscribers. Heading into today, Teladoc is up 507% in our Investment Opportunities portfolio, and Livongo is up 313% in our Early Stage Investor portfolio.
Now they’re joining forces, and the deal looks like this. Each share of Livongo will be exchanged for 0.592 shares of Teladoc plus $11.33 per share in cash. After the merger, Teladoc shareholders will own about 58% of the company while Livongo shareholders will own about 42%.
Based on Teladoc’s closing price yesterday ($249.42), the deal values Livongo at $158.98 per share, about 10% above its August 4 closing price.
The new company will be called Teladoc Health (TDOC) and will be based in New York. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
Projected growth for the combined company is impressive. Management expects pro forma revenue of $1.3 billion here in fiscal 2020 – an 85% increase over last year. By the end of the second year, revenue will increase $100 million due to synergies. Cost savings will amount to $60 million. Management also estimates that revenue synergies will reach an annual run rate of $500 million within five years.
Both stocks hit new all-time highs yesterday before the deal was announced this morning… and now both stocks are down on the news today.
Here is my view on the deal in both the short term and the long term:
As far as today’s action goes, I am not surprised to see the stocks fall. The acquiring company (Teladoc) typically drops after a merger is announced. The acquiree (Livongo) usually goes up. However, both are down this morning because a large portion of the deal is based off Teladoc’s stock price. In the short term, there will be high volatility as investors try to figure out if it’s a good deal or not.
It is.
And as you know, I couldn’t care less about day-to-day fluctuations in stocks. I look at the big picture, and with two telehealth leaders combining to form an absolute juggernaut, the long-term outlook is extremely bullish.
Teladoc’s dominant market share combined with Livongo’s business model of helping people at home with chronic disease is a win-win. I love this deal for both companies, regardless of any wild swings in the short term.
Here’s a number to give you an idea of just how big telehealth is and will be: Before the pandemic, there were a few thousand visits per week in the United States. That number is now at about one million telehealth visits per week. And just this week, President Trump signed a bill that will help expand telehealth services, especially in rural areas where it is much needed.
I’m included in that million-visit figure this week. Just yesterday, I had a five-minute call with my doctor, which was so much better than wasting two hours of my day going back and forth to the office. This is the future. And the newly combined company of Teladoc and Livongo is the clear leader in this hypergrowth trend.
Continue to hold your shares for much bigger gains in the years ahead.

8/5/20, 12:46 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: This is a hard question. I have multiple subscriptions. The Motely Fool is the best one for now for me. This particular one I keep paying but did not visited the site in last 3 months. Brought few on recommendation but did not see much traction on most of them.
8/5/20, 12:47 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: I brougt TDOC at 54 based on Motely Fool's recommendation.
8/5/20, 12:48 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: LVGO. I just brougt because I keep trying few promising IPOs.

8/5/20, 1:31 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Good for you. I had joined earlier and had positive experience with them, but  later figure out that my own research suits me even better for finding targeted stocks. 

As always their service will have 100's of recommendations (some will work, some not) and I just want to invest in the 30 best stock out there.
8/5/20, 4:52 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: FSLY what happened 🤣🤣

8/5/20, 5:08 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: But I liquidated half my position yesterday at 116.
8/5/20, 5:09 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: But it will come back in a week.
8/5/20, 5:10 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: I bough at 115 😜😜
8/5/20, 5:11 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Stay Calm. More importantly you have to stay in the market.
8/5/20, 5:17 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Ok to buy more at this price or wait to go more down
8/5/20, 5:19 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Do not go by AH trades. Yesterday PAYC reported it was down 15 in AH. Today it is up 15.
8/5/20, 5:19 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: But FSLY us a good long term buy.
8/5/20, 5:19 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: But AH down around $17
8/5/20, 5:20 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: I had calls expiring 8/21 so have to liquidate half. And kept half in anticipation for upside.
8/5/20, 5:21 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Company beat and raised guidance. What else you look for.
8/5/20, 5:21 PM - +1 (508) 502-8459: Next level marketing Tesla  + generators  combo 😀
8/5/20, 5:22 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Looking at this, if EV is in demand, then look for any good generator stock for future 😆
8/5/20, 5:26 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: 😄😄
8/5/20, 5:34 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: These are the buying opportunities. I brought TDOC even it went down $45 for no reason.
8/5/20, 5:35 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Nahi to pooraa jindagi Kostey raho aur intezaar karo. Jab giraa to darr gaye.
8/5/20, 5:35 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Jab nahi giraa to girney kaa intezaar kartey rahey.
8/5/20, 5:35 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: It is paradoxical. People want both ways
8/5/20, 5:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: This stock went up 600% in no time, this decline doesn't even matter in the big scheme of things
8/5/20, 5:38 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Sanjay Bhai, aab bata rhe ho jab ye aapne 52 w high pe hai 🙁
8/5/20, 5:39 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Even I couldn’t understand the reason for such a huge drop but then bought few more at 210... I am sure it will go back to 250 in matter of months if not weeks
8/5/20, 5:40 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It can’t be at 53 week high today as it was 250+ few days week
8/5/20, 5:40 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: *52 week
8/5/20, 5:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Stocks moves in waves.  Nothing goes up in a straight line, weak hands get wiped out, people take profits etc. Its easier to forecast a beat, much difficult to predict the reaction to the stock price after the beat, even everything goes all right.
8/5/20, 5:45 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Trading before earnigs to get on the right side of the trade is a highly uncertain business, and odds may not be better than a coin flip.
8/5/20, 5:45 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: <Media omitted>
8/5/20, 5:49 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 52 week high is 253 in the screen shot
8/5/20, 5:50 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Again an opportunity is presented. Use it or loose it in the fear of loosing it.
8/5/20, 6:57 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I have seen so many failed acquisitions. HP bought both consulting firms and hardware firms, just to kill them and write off. Same with IBM. 
The future depends on how TDOC manages LVGO, if it let the latter grow independently or try to fit forcefully. I totally understand why investors are upset.
8/5/20, 6:59 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I see it’s 50-50 chances. So take your own calculated risk.
8/5/20, 7:05 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 👍🏻 While Sanjay bhai is focusing only on his best bets, I know some of their duds. I lost money on several, ANAB, IQ and TWOU for example. And they manipulated their charts to remove ANAB, even edited their suggested price.
8/5/20, 7:06 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: So it’s better to do your own research, if you can’t, stick with good ETFs.
8/5/20, 7:08 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Don’t want to sound negative, it’s just my perspective.
8/5/20, 8:40 PM - +1 (972) 754-6465 joined using this group's invite link
8/5/20, 10:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I appreciate the concern and believe me I too have seen many M&A's fail either due to poor integration, cultural misfit or company paying too high of a premium.

 I also recognize the fact that today's volume was the highest in the history of both stocks, suggesting institutional participation, and they did not like what they saw. I generally don't buys at highs, so I cautiously watching the chart.  That said I like the merger because of the following reasons

1. TDOC is yin to LVGO's yang. One takes care of patients during the visit, the other after the visit. They fit nicely together. 

2. Telehealth and Chronic disease management (applied tech) are the two most exciting areas in healthcare and are as early as in their life cycle as e-commerce was 5-10 yrs ago.

3. In one study, Covid has accelerated the use of Telehealth, even then a small percentage of the world utilizes it. Its expected to grown 25%+ in next 10 yrs. Thats a 8 fold growth

4. There are 400k members in LVGO platform (diabetes). It would be a shame, if it does not tap into the 70 million patients that uses TDOC as a primary source of telecare. Once you are in Livango's platform, you are there for a really long time. 

 5. The combine company will be valued around 35bn. The revenue for both is estimated to grow at 40% next year to 1.8bn giving it 20x revenue multiple. While on the face its pricey, on a relative basis, its much better than the high flyer tech companies out there, trading between 30-50x

6. TDOC and LVGO on a combined basis grew over 100% in the most recent quarter, so there is an argument to be made that the 40% growth market is expecting next year is conservative. It all depends on when covid gets over, as its giving a boost to telemedicine. 

Overall, I see this merger as a way to not only play applied health science but the entirety of telemedicine. I find this area very interesting and expect they will both leverage their platform to create an undisputed powerhouse. That said, if I am going to learn other  than what I have laid out above, I may reconsider my position. Hope this helps put the deal in perspective.
8/5/20, 10:49 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks for sharing this, I am also bullish on this merger hence increased my teladoc position today post it dipped around 20%.

However, now I am getting little confused and thinking that I should have bought Livongo instead of Teladoc today.
As this merger would take place in December 2020 and before that they have to go through lot of approvals including shareholder approval. 
Could you share your thoughts around the following-
1.> Is there a chance that this merger could be called off.
2.> Should an investor invest in both the stocks to be on safer side.
8/5/20, 10:49 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: TDOC is down 15% and LVGO almost 9%. So which one you guys recommend to buy?
8/5/20, 10:54 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Must have adjusted to merger ratio announced. % moves will be same from tomorrow
8/5/20, 10:58 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Right, it’s already started to reflect. LVGO = .59% of TDOC+ $11 which is 123+11=134.
8/5/20, 10:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They will move in lockstep. LVGO will get 0.59 shares of TDOC + $11 cash. Based on TDOC $202 price = 202×.59 + 11 = $130 price.
8/5/20, 10:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So its trading at $2 discount
8/5/20, 11:26 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: Thanks ... this is very helpful

Usually , if SMA crosses upper band and then falls below from upper band the SELL , if SMA crosses lower band and rises up then BUY

8/6/20, 3:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There is always a method to the madness - Tik Tok is the largest customer of Fastly, and there is a possibility that it will be banned by Trump, if the deal does not work out with Microsoft. Fastly serves the enterprise segment, so they have large customer concentration

Roku, while the results are good, it did not provide guidance given the weak advertising demand.

At this point of time, I am not participating in any stocks, unless it looks compelling.

8/6/20, 3:27 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: *Fastly reported quarterly results and an outlook that topped Wall Street estimates, but revealed that TikTok was the company’s single largest customer, accounting for 12% of revenue. Fastly is a so-called “edge-based” cloud-computing platform that allows developers to get the best possible performance from their applications.*
8/6/20, 3:33 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Would be interesting to see how cloudflare performs post earnings today! 🤞
8/6/20, 5:08 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: High level seems like they did really well, but profit taking is in play for high flyers
8/7/20, 8:36 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: We added 1.7MM jobs 
Item 2,3,4 and 5 is still relevant.
8/7/20, 10:33 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: look no support to FSLY 🤣
8/7/20, 10:34 AM - +1 (201) 850-0875: Revenue from TIKTOK weighs in...
8/7/20, 10:36 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: As I remember, that only 12%
8/7/20, 10:36 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: game going on as low volume, stock down
8/7/20, 10:44 AM - +1 (201) 850-0875: Which is at risk for now and that seems to be dragging the stock.
8/7/20, 11:16 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: only 12% what rest.. If Microsoft bought that use their own solution for cloud. So this 12% business gone for FSLY
8/7/20, 11:19 AM - +1 (201) 850-0875: In both ways, it's going to be a loss of 12%. Either TIKTOK gets banned or gets taken over by MSFT.
8/7/20, 11:21 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Given the run up they had, they can come down to $75, and still be bullish
8/7/20, 11:21 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: In their charts
8/7/20, 11:21 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: which is why i didn't buy
8/7/20, 11:25 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: High level, no one will even recall this drop a year from now. Edge computing is necessary ingredient to better customer service in today's world, and fastly is executing this. 

They need to diversify their customer base though. Cloudfare is much more diversified than fastly and as a result will exhibit lower volatility.
8/7/20, 11:27 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The last I checked it (net) was up 15%+ for the week
8/7/20, 11:27 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Looking at wrong chart
8/7/20, 11:28 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: For net its up 3%
8/7/20, 11:49 AM - +1 (213) 568-8440: So, this is the time to say finally goodbye to Fastly, before it goes down anymore ?????
8/7/20, 12:09 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Where did I say this?
8/7/20, 12:09 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: 👍🤣
8/7/20, 12:11 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: No, i was asking this,, coz it's getting lower  😊
8/7/20, 12:12 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: i bought it 116 and still holding 😰
8/7/20, 12:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I will not be worried about this as long as its above 74-75 range, it may even be a buying opportunity then. 

The trend will change below this number
8/7/20, 12:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The above is only for trading, long term, there is  still significant potential
8/7/20, 12:14 PM - +1 (781) 774-0196: <Media omitted>
8/7/20, 12:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: No one will be able to answer this question, and it all depends on what the markets are going to do. If  the markets fall, given how extended they are (and there is more risk today, than over the past 3 months), this will follow. Overall, as long as it does not break $185-$190, its still in an uptrend. 

As I own already have a full position in LVGO/TDOC at really low basis, I am not buying anything.
8/7/20, 12:33 PM - +1 (781) 774-0196: Okay, that makes sense. I more or less tend to swing over a few days, and don't keep long positions, so I guess I'll take my chances. Thank You for your input! 🙂

8/7/20, 2:53 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: TDOC is 10% down again today, is there anybody else in the group who entered around 150 saw it jumped to 250 and now back to 190 in just a matter of few weeks. 
Has something changed fundamentally to this stock, the Livongo acquisition looks to be good only, why are people pulling out of this stock? Am I missing something... this can’t be just profit booking right?
8/7/20, 2:58 PM - +1 (972) 754-6465: Bought Tesla 1500 call at 12 Rs and sold at 10$. Now call is trading at 12 cents 😉

8/7/20, 3:00 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Lot of pumping and dumping going on in the market.
8/7/20, 3:00 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It should not be like this.
8/7/20, 3:00 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I hope sanity is restored soon.
8/7/20, 3:03 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Market is ruthless.

8/7/20, 3:05 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: 🤑🤑🤑
8/7/20, 3:11 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: How you convert Rs. To $ in stock 🤣🤣
8/7/20, 5:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The stock had went from $50 to $250 in a matter of months (400%) and have come back 20% during the week. You bought towards the high, its absolutely normal for stocks to experience this kind of volatility, particularly when you have the uncertainty of acquisition on hand.
8/7/20, 5:27 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks, also when you say uncertainty of acquisition, do you mean that the acquisition might not go through eventually as it require shareholders approval as well. Or is there some other uncertainty.
8/7/20, 5:34 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its a large acquisition, the companies are of similar size. I think they will work well together, but a lot of things have to go right to get to that state along with shareholder approval. 

The good news is that they are at a support and the volumes of selling has been declining over the last 3 days, weaker hands will sooner or later get exhausted
8/7/20, 5:35 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks, appreciate your views.

8/7/20, 5:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The positives - 

- Its a beautiful chart in an uptred
- More greens, less red
- Hugging the blue line

The negatives are
- Big red volume candle
- Signs of reversal

We'll know either way next week. If it breaks to the downside, I will be partially sell some of my long term position and wait for better entry

Long term I like both companies (though I love Livango)
8/7/20, 5:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: *Livango more
8/7/20, 5:50 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Understood, would appreciate if you could post here in the group in case you decide to sell and when you think of buying more, If you could.
8/7/20, 5:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Since I already have a full position at low basis for both stocks, my position is very different than yours. I will just be selling 1/3rd of my position at huge gain, as I want to limit my downside risk, id it goes to the downside 

 If you have just entered the stock and intend to hold for long term, you should think of averaging it rather than selling it. 

I also don't want to create a precedent for everyone to follow my footsteps, as I am not a financial advisor. The above is my opinion of how it should be handled.
8/7/20, 6:13 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Ok, thanks
8/7/20, 6:16 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Will hold till my entry point for now, and if it goes further down will decide as per the condition on whether to buy more or move out completely

8/11/20, 10:44 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Most of the growth Stocks are down significantly, eg Tesla, Fastly,Cloudflare, square, livongo, teladoc. I own most of these and just two weeks back my portfolio was 80-90% up. But now I have lost almost 50% of the gain. 
Is anyone else sailing the same boat as me, if yes, what are you planning to do, hold, buy more or just book profit and sit tight.
8/11/20, 10:51 AM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Same here with me on Tesla, NIO, Moderna, Teladoc
8/11/20, 10:52 AM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Recommendation please
8/11/20, 11:06 AM - +1 (717) 385-7085: NIO to thik hai...
8/11/20, 11:08 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: It depends on ur trading style.
8/11/20, 11:08 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Some sell 1/4th, take profits
8/11/20, 11:09 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Some holds the core position, and take the remaining profits
8/11/20, 11:09 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Etc...etc...
8/11/20, 11:09 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: 😀
8/11/20, 11:13 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: We had the greatest and the broadest rally in the history of the stock market. It is fascinating how fast we have gone up in too short a period. While I had been pounding the table to buy when market was 2200-2500 (when almost everyone was a bear), the current levels in the market does not seem very attractive, at-least in the short term. I think market had become uber bullish (put call levels), and there is kind of speculativr frenzy developing where everything in being bought at the dip. I think markets need to consolidate or even pullback before moving ahead. 

While I should not comment on individual stocks, the decline coming in some of the best stocks that I have suggested indicates that market may be at a turning point. As a result, its prudent for me to lock some of the gains that I have made during this period. I am not fully selling out, because we are initial stage of the bull market, but I am cautiously raising cash and becoming defensive where I am comfortable with my allocation to weather the next pullback.
8/11/20, 11:20 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks for sharing your views, is there a specific reason that you are not buying the dips specially for Fastly, Teladoc/livongo
8/11/20, 11:20 AM - +1 (201) 736-9742 left
8/11/20, 11:21 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I mean for long term

8/11/20, 11:27 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: AYX is significantly down.
8/11/20, 11:27 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Wondering if it's an opportunity for call options
8/11/20, 11:27 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Thoughts?
8/11/20, 11:30 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
8/11/20, 11:31 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: See the chart above
8/11/20, 11:33 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I like to buy when market pullsback, rather than individual stock pull-back (which may be due to idiosyncratic issues with the stock), though i am sure we will get an opportunity in the short term.
8/11/20, 11:35 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Then it also means to sell existing stocks by realizing whatever the profits you have assuming there will be a pull back soon and enter again at lower price point (unless you are long-term investor)?
8/11/20, 11:37 AM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: It is market rotation. People (big pockets) are pulling money out of growth stock to value stock. 
Just sit tight. These are testing times.
8/11/20, 11:38 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am long term investor but it doesnt mean that I take some bets off the table and eat the gravy that had been made for some time. 

I do not sell full position because 1. its extremely difficult to perfectly time the market 2. Some stocks may be undervalued and may even perform well during the pullback
8/11/20, 11:40 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Risk management is paramount to capital preservation, and I like to be aggressive when markets are on the downside and reduce my risk, when it goes up significantly.
8/11/20, 11:42 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: That is true also, but value  becomes fully valued and growth is stretched, where does money goes? Market moves in waves, and its only prudent for markets to pullback.
8/11/20, 11:56 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Interesting.
In the last week or so Nasdaq has pulled back arnd 200 points , do you think it will go 300-400 points more before it starts to go up or do you anticipate a larger dip, like arnd 1000+
8/11/20, 12:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: No way to tell. Though, I would like it to be a deeper decline, so i can load up again.
8/11/20, 12:01 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I guess Nash is suggesting to book 50% as it is difficult to time the market, but finally it is individual’s call as it’s their money after all 😁
8/11/20, 12:04 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Really testing time... I was thinking it is going to go up at the same pace at least till the elections, but....
8/11/20, 12:04 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks 😊
8/11/20, 12:07 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: With very little knowledge and observation i feel this swing is a shift between pandemic and non-pandemic affected sectors and it will continue going as we hear any positive or negative news. Recently, as soon as talks of relief package started all banks, airlines are rallying and tech down. As soon as covid news take toll again people would be back in tech stocks. These are not normal times.
8/11/20, 12:29 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I would not put a number. It will vary based on individual risk tolerance and capacity
8/11/20, 12:37 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Do we have Tesla bulls in the group , post earnings, there is no news on S&P inclusion also the stock has lost 20% + post earnings. The only push for near terms that I could foresee is the battery day in September, it could also fall flat though.
I am getting inclined to book some profit as I am still 90%+ up on it. Please share your views.
8/11/20, 12:37 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍

8/11/20, 2:45 PM - Niteen: Any suggestion for 401k strategy? Stay the course?
8/11/20, 2:47 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: 401k strategy is never based on last few weeks or even months.
If you’re approaching age you and have already been in conservative portfolio (MM and bonds etc) proportionate to your risk appetite.
If you’re early to mid aged and far from retirement, then current fluctuations etc don’t factor that much - aggressive 401k investors see opportunity with stocks though..

Just my 2c
8/11/20, 2:54 PM - Niteen: So, basically fire and forget.
8/11/20, 2:57 PM - Niteen: Any other thoughts?
8/11/20, 3:03 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: I agree to this viewpoint. Depends on the time horizon when you need the money. What i have read is over the period of 10 years investment in equity fund beats the bond or MM hands on. Beauty with 401k installments is you get more units when mkt is down and once the mkt is backup you would see good growth. In my personal opinion i dont like target funds
8/11/20, 3:09 PM - Niteen: Thanks Nikunj and Manik for sharing your thoughts and opinions. I'm asking this question bcoz there was recommendation around March to cash out (at least trim down the exposure) if you think market is going South..I'm not saying that market is going to behave that way which it did early this year..but looks like the best strategy to remain invested.
8/11/20, 3:12 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: you can do that if you can time the market perfectly. if you have a good time horizon then should not matter.
8/11/20, 3:13 PM - Niteen: 👍
8/11/20, 3:26 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: This is great answer. For most people (even professionals) its extremely difficult to time the market. The overall trend is still up. Even the market comes down 5-10%, its a blip on what it has done or is expected to do over real long term.
8/11/20, 3:50 PM - Niteen: 👍

8/11/20, 6:58 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: And still holding
8/11/20, 7:00 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: It will adjust accordingly
8/11/20, 8:58 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Yes but technically, he own 5 shorts share after 31st at price of $100. Which is very hard to hit. Thats my point

8/12/20, 10:39 AM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: To me it looks like people in this group is so fixated with TSLA that they are just missing out other opportunities presented.
8/12/20, 10:40 AM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: TSLA is just a ticker. If you are in stock market to make money.
8/12/20, 10:40 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: 👌 👍 👌
8/12/20, 10:41 AM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: And if you like or love the company buy their product and services.

8/12/20, 10:59 AM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Sorry then you should worry.
8/12/20, 10:59 AM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Or else enjoy the stock market ride.
8/12/20, 11:21 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Hi Sanjay,
As you know I am new and don’t have much awareness about other opportunities that I might be missing out however my fascination towards Tesla stock is because of following-
1. Before the Q1 earning(April 2020) I entered in Tesla at 650.I Sold it post results at 850.(was heavily invested, made few grands)
2. Re-entered the stock @688 when Elon tweeted that Tesla stock is too high. And having my position since then. I was about to sell some yesterday but then thought to wait for couple of days and fortunately it’s rallying today post the split announcement.
For a new bee like me, I am unable to find another stock which would give me this kind of return.(regret to sell Shopify early)
I do own NET, Teladoc and Square. All were going well, however this Teladoc is giving me trouble from last week post their acquisition.
As I am in the market, and here TSLA is just a ticker for me, nothing else. 
Having said that,I do like Elon musk and his vision though and my next car purchase would be a Tesla as well.( hoping the stocks to sponsor the same one day😁).
8/12/20, 11:23 AM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: You make me jealous. You are definitely in the market to make money.
8/12/20, 11:25 AM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: They way you sat patiently for TSLA to grow. Wait for TDOC. It may pay off. And Hey it is stock market. All your trades cannot be a winning trade.
8/12/20, 11:28 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: That’s true may be would take some time to get accustomed to the downs, on a lighter note, cursing the guy from the management who thought of this acquisition though 😁
8/12/20, 11:31 AM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: He was a visionary. They want to create next generation tele medicine  powered by AI. Who will go for a doctor with drive wait appointment taking a day off just to get a anti-biotic when you can do it virtually from office and home and your medicine is ready at Walgreens for pick up.
8/12/20, 11:37 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Totally aligned on the vision, hope the execution of the acquisition to be smooth too.
8/12/20, 11:48 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Telemedicine is the future  of healthcare, and Teladoc had done good in the other acquisitions so far, so I am optimistic that this will be a multibagger in years to come.
8/12/20, 11:49 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Amen 🙏
8/12/20, 11:51 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Here is a detailed commentary of what's possible.
8/12/20, 12:10 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: <Media omitted>
8/12/20, 12:18 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: There are 2 ways that I know you can make money like rental money on your assets. In this case One is by Divends and other is covered calls.
8/12/20, 12:19 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Paisaa aa rahaa hai jaisey caaho invest karo kharchaa karo. Iss case mey re-invest karney bol rahaa hai. Nash or Neeraj or anyone else can guide you more.
8/12/20, 12:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I dont use this platform, but this seems like a simple reinvestment of the dividend you had received on any stock or funds. Assuming you get 2% dividend from Starbucks payable in 4 quarter (0.5% each), this money will go into buying starbucks for that corresponding amount. If you don't need the money and are invested in dividend paying stocks, this is a good way to reinvest your capital over time.
8/12/20, 12:42 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: Thank you Both for your valuable inputs 🙏🏻
8/12/20, 2:04 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Tesla - I think it is making sure that before split the price will go so high that even after split it is not easy for everyone to get in Tesla.
8/12/20, 2:07 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Fir double split maarna padega tesla ko. The whole point of split is to make the stock accessible to more shareholders 😊
8/12/20, 2:09 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: correct but if it will reach 1800-2000 before 28th August then basically it is adding at least $100 on each stock after split.

8/14/20, 9:39 AM - +1 (781) 774-0196: TDOC might break past the former support turned resistance level today. If it can successfully break the blue trend line, another buying opportunity?

8/14/20, 10:14 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Hi All,
Is anyone invested in lemonade(LMND)? Also, has anyone subscribed to their insurance services, are they really hassle free on claims, any first hand experience would be appreciated.

Please share your expert views on this stock as in if this is the right time to start building position in the stock or should I wait for couple of weeks etc.

8/16/20, 5:50 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Nvidia. Is Millionair stock in couple of years. Autonomous Vehicles and AI is going to make it bigger than anyone else. But it will take some time.
8/17/20, 10:10 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Guys, any views on this stock?

8/17/20, 10:40 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I read about it over the weekend. They give out the profits to the charity of your choice. Then how they make money?
8/17/20, 10:40 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Didn’t understand several things in their business model.
8/17/20, 10:40 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Passing on.
8/17/20, 10:43 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: Lemonade is an interesting insurance company in that it doesn’t make its money off of excess premiums.
Instead, it collects a flat fee with every payment and donates leftover funds to various organizations each year.
The idea here is that this keeps the company from fighting against insurance holders that need complete coverage due to unfortunate circumstances.
8/17/20, 11:36 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: The business model looks attractive and might disrupt the insurance sector all together, however, as it is a growth company so has a long way to go, not sure if they would be able to sustain and raise fund in the near future. They did increase their customer base and revenue for this quarter but still are far away from profitability.
The charity thing seems to be a marketing gimmick to me, it’s like highlighting the CSR activities(personal opinion).

Need suggestion/views on buying 40-50 stocks and holding it for an year or two....
8/17/20, 11:41 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Also, if anyone else is evaluating any other growth stock to invest, please share.

8/17/20, 2:06 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Not sure if target price, but I am going to hold it for at least an year from here. There might be some more hiccups in December but in long run it might give extra ordinary returns
8/17/20, 2:09 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Thanks Biplab
8/17/20, 2:09 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Aisa ek baar ka tukka aapke 5-10 losses ko cover kar sakta hai. So everytime tukka maarte rehne ka 😀

8/18/20, 11:27 AM - +1 (781) 774-0196: I got in at $197 when it reached the trend line, then it dipped further and had to wait. Now took profit at 212 only cause i didn't want to hold it any longer
8/18/20, 11:27 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Ok, thanks.

8/18/20, 1:25 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: These are some fascinating numbers. This is up rougly 50% from the time we discussed vs the S&P performance of roughly 3% during this period.
8/18/20, 1:26 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Long runaway for growth and expect it to be multibagger in years to come 👍
8/18/20, 1:31 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: For teladoc, we discussed $185 and above as the support when it was falling like a knife. The lowest close was $183.60. Under "normal market conditions" my numbers should work most of the time
8/18/20, 1:34 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍... good to see that it’s back in track.
8/18/20, 1:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Offcourse if market pulls the rug out, and there is nowhere to hide, all stocks will be decemiatated
8/18/20, 1:35 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I dint buy it then, would it be good to enter now or shall I wait for sometime for it to consolidate and settle
8/18/20, 1:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It seems like it has bottomed, however, as I discussed there is risk in broader market. I am looking for a shorter term turn in the market, hopefully, there is another opportunity
8/18/20, 1:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The risk is that the turn does not come and even if it comes, it does not ho to that level.
8/18/20, 1:40 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: How about an years horizon from here?
8/18/20, 1:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I would keep horizon of 3-5yrs
8/18/20, 1:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: For stocks that have run up, but have significant potential
8/18/20, 1:42 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Ok, thanks
8/18/20, 1:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: As a general matter, its always prudent to keep cash handy and load up stocks when the market crashes. A market sees a 5-10% decline every year or 2. This stats helps take care of opportunity in stocks we love.
8/18/20, 1:46 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Good insight, actually got my IT return and now there is this itch to invest , I should better hold it and wait for a dip
8/18/20, 1:47 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: 😀

8/20/20, 11:20 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Same story with Fastly as was with at $185. The lowest close after this message was $74.96, it was a buying opportunity for people who did not have allocation. 

As long as the broader market does not tank, they seems to have bottomed.
8/20/20, 11:20 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: *as was wity Teladoc

8/20/20, 7:31 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: If you are an absolute beginner then start with opening a brokerage account with a reliable institution. I personally like TDAmeritrade.
8/20/20, 7:35 PM - +1 (917) 375-1299: After opening account, try buying just one stock to practice.
Track stock related news and updates, try to calculate sell point. 

This will help you to get real time training and helps to build traders mindset.
8/20/20, 7:38 PM - +1 (646) 744-7953: Thank you Aditya and Yogesh🙏🙏
8/20/20, 7:39 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: 👍 Sumit, investing in the stock is near compulsory now given all newly printed money ends up in stock market before it trickles down on main street
8/20/20, 8:08 PM - +1 (781) 774-0196: If you want to learn the basics, and are willing to spend some time reading, www.investopedia.com is a great place to learn! 👍
8/20/20, 8:12 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Whatever you do, don’t buy high 😁
Especially if you’re on west coast you’d always be late as a day trader 😄
8/20/20, 8:12 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Investorpedia is good
8/20/20, 8:17 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: High always go high. At one point I thought TSLA was high at $400 and shop at $450. Most of us loose lot of good things just in bargain hunting.
8/20/20, 8:18 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: It other thing that you go shopping when there is a sale going on overall.
8/20/20, 8:21 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Most beloved / talked about stock here is Tesla.
It’s odd as a good stock but it is.
Company is only marginally profitable and is a manufacturing company so it can’t turn on a dime. Even then it’s growth is good. I think a lot of the hyped stocks the youngsters are luring to get in for are hyped.
8/20/20, 8:22 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: By “its growth” I meant stock price growth not company growth
8/20/20, 8:23 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Splits are going to fuel things up even more (or charge things up if you’re an EV lover like me) 😀
8/20/20, 8:23 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Amazon is another obvious riser - even thou it’s already high
8/20/20, 8:24 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Brick and mortar, airlines, restaurants and overall hospitality sectors can kiss good bye to profits for a while. So no point getting there
8/20/20, 8:24 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: And then election outcome will put another spin on already covid spun / spinning market
8/20/20, 8:25 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: If Dems rise or win, typically markets tank. Not sure this time.
8/20/20, 9:09 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Few pointers that I think should benefit anyone who is new in the market. I wish someone should have told me this when I started. 

1. First few investment should be in companies that is easy for you to understand and that you could relate to. I would start with at least 5 high quality large cap stocks. 

2. Don't start with a trader mindset. Invest is good companies for long term with the intent to hold it forever. Stats suggest the longer you hold (only good companies), the higher is your chance of positive price expectancy. 

3. Ignore news (particularly economic forecast and doomsday prediction) coming from people in mainstream media. They are designed to let you sell your stock. Remember stock market is a mechanism to take away money from a) emotional to rational b) impatient to patient.

4) With respect to 3, if the market tanks, you should increase your allocation to stock. Assume you start with 50-50 allocation to debt and equity, every 5-10% decrease in the market, should allow you to increase your allocation by 5-10%  in stocks. Always have a plan/cash handy for opportunities (drawdowns) presented by the market. 

5. Add to your winners (business performance) and cut your losers. Don't run after hot tips and penny stocks. 

6. Learn and read about basic fundamental and technical analysis, read quarterly reports for companies you follow, ask questions on things that you dont understand. 

I wish you luck. May the markets be with you.

8/21/20, 1:13 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: Look at the companies and products you use and personally trust. For example, I bought SunRun shares as I went through the process of buying Solar Panel on my house and seeing value in the company’s growth and business model. It paid me well.
8/21/20, 1:20 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: 100% Agree, I work in Mongodb and cloud, so I got Mongodb & NET.
Got good return.
8/21/20, 1:33 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: In that case,, should I sell tesla share,, as I have Honda crv not Tesla ..

😂😂😂
8/21/20, 1:33 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: Just kidding 😂
8/21/20, 1:33 PM - +1 (201) 208-1249: No. Now buy a Tesla.
8/21/20, 1:34 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: Or sell Honda and buy Tesla. 😃
8/21/20, 1:37 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: That’s what I was going to say. I bought Tesla Model 3 and used for for a few months before buying Tesla stocks last year. I am almost getting 780% returns
8/21/20, 1:37 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: 👍🏻
8/21/20, 1:47 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: This one point I missed for a long time. I have been using Microsoft products for almost 2 decades and apple products for a decade. And very badly missed on both of them.
8/21/20, 1:47 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: Haan to kya
8/21/20, 1:49 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: Yup, point to be. ✅
8/21/20, 1:49 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: *noted
8/21/20, 1:55 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: Exactly
8/21/20, 2:00 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Doesnt work all the time guys. I loved Fitbit as a consumer and still love it but not the stock. So i wont generalise this. I think we should understand the company and using the products is a contributor in that process.
8/21/20, 2:03 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: You have a valid point. No strategy works 100% of the time in Stock market. You need to combine multiple things to make best bet
8/21/20, 2:07 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Any recommendations on MU? It's trading at lower price currently. Good time to enter?
8/21/20, 2:18 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: It doesn’t seems to have good support till 36. From technical analysis, I would wait till it finds the support
8/21/20, 2:22 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: <Media omitted>
8/21/20, 2:23 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Guys need some suggestion on your strategy on holding cash and waiting for the right opportunity to buy stock on a dip.I mean, right now everything is going up so I believe you all must be holding your purchases for now. 
However, on the other hand do you guys also get the feeling that the money is lying in the current account which is not growing. How do you tackle this kind of situation?
8/21/20, 2:28 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: 👍🏻
8/21/20, 3:45 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: This one is tough to answer as it depends on individual’s risk capacity.
Personally, I am holding 50% of my cash and still playing with smaller bets on daily/weekly basis
8/21/20, 3:46 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: Also, I setup stop loss on some of my stock where I can pull the money quickly if Market is going nose down
8/21/20, 3:49 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks, so no long term investments at this stage for you than. Do you not get tempted to increase stake in your long term winners...I am getting hence asking 😁
8/21/20, 3:52 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: i guess controlling that khujali (temptation) is the whole game here :)
8/21/20, 3:53 PM - +1 (201) 838-3517: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
8/21/20, 3:55 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: I did raised my investment a little bit on some. But still being very cautious as it’s very tough to say what will happen in next month or two
8/21/20, 4:00 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yaa.... but seeing money put in investments giving significant gain and money not invested lying there with no growth is giving this itch 😜.

Am just trying to understand that if I am planning to hold a stock for long term, then if I invest in one of my existing position which has given me significant gain would increase the average cost but in long run, that might be negligible , hence  trying to get more views on this
8/21/20, 4:18 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Let me give an example, Teladoc, o entered at 150, it went till 250 and post merger announcement it started to fall, I bought few more at 210 ( should have waited here as it went till low 180s) I think still Teladoc a good buy at 225. As I am going to hold it for at least 2 years from here. Hence putting this query forward.
8/21/20, 4:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I dont like to keep significant chunk of money in current accounts. Here are a few ideas to get yield on investments. 

1. Invest in shorter term CD's which generate around 2%. Dont feel bad to liquidate when opportunity arise and forego some portion of interest
2. Invest in fixed income securities (mortgages, high yield corporate bonds, emerging market debt). This will produce 5-10% return longer term while you wait. 
3. Lending tree - Peer to peer lending, After defaults, I average around 8-10%, however its less liquid
4. Crowdfunding real estate platform - Specific real estate knowledge is required, but can produce 15%+ on good private real estate deals.
8/21/20, 4:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Realtymogul is great crowdsourcing website.
8/21/20, 4:23 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: I entered at 54. It went from 250 to 180. Lot got scared. I brought 4 contract during the plunge. They are paying me good.
8/21/20, 4:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 3rd one is lending club
8/21/20, 4:31 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: 👍
8/21/20, 4:37 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Good companies with right vision always bounce back. Try to add more when opportunity is presented.
8/21/20, 4:38 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Currently I am not equipped to invest in any of these as I don’t understand them well. Will try to dig and get some more insight. Thanks for the information though.
8/21/20, 4:45 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 1 and 2 should be easy. Marcus allows you open a high interest saving account, that is significantly higher than your regular saving account. 
The 2nd one is simply buying good mutual fund in your brokerage account.
8/21/20, 4:47 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Exactly, Teladoc is still available at a discount of 10-12% from its peak, it will be 250 back in next few weeks...
8/21/20, 4:49 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: Discover or Capital One has higher interest rates then Marcus ( 0.80% )
8/21/20, 4:49 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: For 2. If I see an opportunity in the market would I be able to liquidate immediately?
8/21/20, 4:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah
8/21/20, 4:50 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Try etf instead
8/21/20, 4:50 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If you want to get in and out quickly
8/21/20, 4:50 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They trade like stocks
8/21/20, 4:51 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: what ETFs are good for safe investment with good return
8/21/20, 4:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: All instruments are subject to market risk
8/21/20, 4:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So nothing is safe, though fixed income etf is less volatile than stocks and generate yields
8/21/20, 4:52 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Ya ... was evaluating Ark invest the other day and they have given amazing returns, but as I was already invested in Tesla and square so I let it go .... any good etf that you would recommend
8/21/20, 4:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ark is similar to investing in growth stocks
8/21/20, 4:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I was talking about safer debt etfs
8/21/20, 4:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Which generate lower returns but is a proxy for cash
8/21/20, 4:54 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Ok.. could you name a few
8/21/20, 4:54 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
8/21/20, 4:54 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Go to ishare website
8/21/20, 4:55 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: VGT
8/21/20, 4:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You can see yields of bond etfd
8/21/20, 4:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: VGT is technology etf
8/21/20, 4:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I think he is looking for safer investmenta
8/21/20, 4:56 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 😄 sage and good return are quite opposite.
8/21/20, 4:57 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Safe*
8/21/20, 4:57 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: 😀 Very True
8/21/20, 4:57 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: But VGT is pretty stable in my opinion.
8/21/20, 4:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The definition of good return also vary from person to person
8/21/20, 4:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Some people are happy with lower single digit returns, so they should not take more risk
8/21/20, 4:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Longer term, there is no issue, shorter term as a proxy for cash, its very risky. For eg, it fell 32% in march
8/21/20, 5:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its a tech stock etf
8/21/20, 5:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Bottom line is risk is generally synonymous with return, but not always, so depending on your risk tolerance you can invest in bonds to stocks to cryptocurrency, to options
8/21/20, 5:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: With increasing order of risk levels
8/21/20, 5:10 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I would like to invest in such an etf which gives me decent returns and cash is available immediately when I see an opportunity in the market to invest.
8/21/20, 5:15 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: How is IVV?
8/21/20, 5:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its the s&p 500 index
8/21/20, 5:17 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It’s avg annual returns are 7.48%
8/21/20, 5:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: But its stocks
8/21/20, 5:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If you are only focusing on  returns, stocks etf may be appropriate for you (only for longer term)
8/21/20, 5:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: But that will have the same losses when your other stocks tank
8/21/20, 5:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It will not provide diversification benefit
8/21/20, 5:19 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Understood
8/21/20, 5:23 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: LQD looks good
8/21/20, 5:27 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its a Investment grade bond fund, which generates 3% yield and will be less volatile than stocks
8/21/20, 5:29 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It did tank in March though ... would it be a safe investment
8/21/20, 5:29 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: But it tanked 20% vs s&p 35%
8/21/20, 5:30 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Ok
8/21/20, 5:30 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It will tank, but less than stocks
8/21/20, 5:30 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Roughly half
8/21/20, 5:33 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: HYG has a lower duration, tanked slightly  higher than 20% in march, and yielding 5%
8/21/20, 5:33 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Lower duration means lower interest rate risk, so if spreads widen, this one will be less effected vs LQD
8/21/20, 5:34 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: But its below investment grade, so has high default risk
8/21/20, 5:34 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It depends on what risk you take and the corresponding return
8/21/20, 5:35 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Ok
8/21/20, 5:52 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I would prefer LQD than, as it will have lesser impact in case of a major market crash.
So basically here is what I understood , I will buy this etf through my trading platform and when I see a buying opportunity in the market, I just sell some portion of the etf and buy the stocks and if I don’t get an opportunity then the money grows in the etf( at a slower pace, off course). In that ways it would be better than keeping cash in current/savings account. The only risk here is during a major market crash and some impact during some big falls, is my understanding right?
8/21/20, 5:56 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: By buying opportunity in the market I mean individual stock falls(stocks from my watch list).
8/21/20, 6:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am not expecting a major market crash, stats does not suggest that. If you are expecting, a treasury etf may be adequate for you. For minor drawdowns, both seems OK to me
8/21/20, 6:12 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: How about trump losing elections..
8/21/20, 6:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You wouldn't hedge that today
8/21/20, 6:12 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Ok
8/21/20, 6:13 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks

8/22/20, 12:10 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Why Double Top has a lower Target?
8/22/20, 1:02 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Typically, the move above and below the neckline is symmetrical if the chart plays out to the textbook. There can be numerous variation though that happens. For eg, a double top towards the high vs towards the low may work out differently depending what support and resistance are below and above it. 

The above is a simplified version of it, and while its important to be aware of how they work, one has to work with the charts day in and day out to catch these perfectly.
8/22/20, 1:10 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Where is falling knife 😄
8/22/20, 1:12 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Double top is a bearish pattern
8/22/20, 1:17 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: I typically find these patterns more helpful for intra day trading as it gives a decent idea of support and resistance levels. For long term investments it shouldn’t matter much.
8/22/20, 1:54 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: 👍🏻Thats nice. Any/particular patterns you find more successful than others? 
In my experience i hv good outcome with falling wedge, bullish rectangle/wedge.

What would happen if stock doesn’t fall and these shorts have to cover for rest of $19Bn. Does anyone has any clue on the timelines these shorts have, are these extreme long term or some major deadline coming in next couple of months.

8/26/20, 9:48 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It's difficult to estimate what price point most shares were shorted. But hold this price for 6 months, I believe shorts drop by 50%
8/26/20, 9:48 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Estimate
8/26/20, 9:56 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks for sharing this. I guess most of the big Tesla investors know this already and hence no one is booking profit at this stage. 
We retailers might also get benefitted of this though 😁

Then as per the stock price algorithm, as there would be lot of buying by these shorts, the stock price will go even higher rt? Or is there some limit or cap there ?

8/26/20, 11:16 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Nikola hydrogen technology has already been proven wrong. Toyota had launched hydrogen based car which failed miserably.
8/26/20, 11:17 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Nikola has to go a long way, they seems to be at POC stage need to see their product in production and market acceptance
8/26/20, 11:17 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Hydrogen is not available in free form on earth.
8/26/20, 11:17 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: And I have 10 Contracts of Nikola = 1000 Shares. Just as a revenge. Since I do not have TSLA
8/26/20, 11:18 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It takes electricity to separate hydrogen from water. Then same hydrogen is used to reclaim initial energy spend. In which case, significant amount of energy is lost
8/26/20, 11:18 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: To me shll and workhorse seems to have better products in comparison to nikola
8/26/20, 11:19 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: While we are in market of no reason and sense, anything can be sold. I wont advise against not investing
8/26/20, 11:25 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Seriously, put money on anything and get 15-20% return in a month or two, specially growth stocks. Barring few the value stocks are not giving this kind of returns though. Anyways, newbies like us are having a ride of our lives 😁
8/26/20, 11:26 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I wish elections moved by an year or so!

8/26/20, 11:28 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Imagine fresh out of boat from India and loosing his 2 years of saving in stocks with no TSLA around. Salary 70K.
8/26/20, 11:28 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: This time will not be for ever hence learning is important if we have to be in the market for long run. When market would be normal this kind of returns would be very difficult to sustain. And then if we fall, it would be a big one
8/26/20, 11:29 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Darr key aagey Jeet hai

8/26/20, 11:34 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: Hold for 2 more years.

8/26/20, 11:35 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Ya
8/26/20, 11:35 PM - Sanjay Minu Prasad: because of margin calls

8/27/20, 2:59 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: *Is Xpeng profitable?*
Not yet. The company posted operating losses of $535 million in 2019 and $202 million in the first half of 2020.
8/27/20, 2:59 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: *How much cash did it have before the IPO?*
As noted above, Xpeng raised $500 million in a private round in July. As of the end of June, it had about $150 million in cash and equivalents, down from $276 million at the end of 2019.

The company's operating cash flow was negative $172 million in the first half of 2020, and negative $504 million in 2019.
8/27/20, 2:59 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: *Is Xpeng stock a buy?*
Given the large number of new electric-vehicle stocks that have hit the market over the last few months (and the also-large number of companies in the space that aren't yet public), I'd suggest that auto investors take a deep breath before diving in here. Personally, I think we need better reads on Xpeng's execution and competitiveness before calling it a buy, and it'll take some time to get those.

That said, if you already own shares of companies like NIO and Li, and you wanted to add a small stake in Xpeng to your electric-vehicle portfolio, I wouldn't argue against it.

8/27/20, 7:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There has been a lot of focus on security, first from cloudfare and then from fastly to provide complete offering to their users. 

It also seems that the field for potential acquirer for Tik Tok (US operations) is ever increasing after
their ceo resigned, suggesting that the Tiktok will continue to be fastly's customer. 

Rightly so Fastly found a bottom at $75 (as I had suggested) and have rallied 30% from the number. 

I am long since $15, but I added a few shares at that number. When technical aligns with fundamentals, you typically get a high quality execution providing the highest reward to risk.

8/29/20, 1:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Given the run up in many of my US Stocks, recently I have been focusing my attention to find international opportunities. Sea limited is one that most of you are familiar with. Another one that I had entered recently is the UK based robotoic process automation company
Blue Prism group (only $1.5bn market cap) 1.5 mos back and over this period it has generated a ~50% return crushing returns for most of my US stocks. Its still significantly undervalued than the proxies here in US, and is a leader in its area per Gartner research. Sending a summary if anyone's interested, however as I have said many times, markets are stretched and if it tanks, everything will come down the elevator. This one obviously will be more risky as its a relatively young foreign company.

9/1/20, 12:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah really. IBM has done nothing over the last 20 years in share price performance. While its trying to re-invest itself and may do so, I consider it dead stock, until it shows some performance.
9/1/20, 12:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Re-invent
9/1/20, 12:53 PM - Niteen: Agree...Both IBM and Oracle have same problem

9/1/20, 1:05 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Most of the big OEMs for that matter.... look at cisco’s results. Webex is their flagship collaboration tool but they sat and let Zoom and Microsoft teams grow right in front of them..... nothing learnt from big failures like Nokia
9/1/20, 1:06 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: So disappointing
9/1/20, 1:38 PM - Niteen: On the other hand it is great to witness these start ups taking over industry giants..challenge the status quo
9/1/20, 1:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: While i am sad that I sold zoom early, I am happy I found a backdoor way to play the zoomification of the world through a small company that is dual headquatered in CA and China (most revenues comes from China).  I entered this mid August, and this is already up 30%.

Usual caveat: everything is getting to nosebleed valuations and if the market corrects, everything will come down the elevator. I am not taking large positions, but enough to keep me in the game.

9/1/20, 4:58 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: usually, for shorter expiry date ( less than 1.5-2 months), the option cost is eaten up by theta ( time decay) if it stays side way for few days
9/1/20, 5:00 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: however looking at how bullish AAPL is, it can be quick gain even in shorter expirty period

9/1/20, 8:29 PM - +1 (419) 215-2329: Yes. This is true. Every one wants to take position in AMZN.
9/1/20, 9:12 PM - +1 (757) 285-8122: Is it still a good buy at current price ?
9/1/20, 9:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Depends on your time horizon. Its only 30% up from my entry and I consider all my picks have multibagger potential.

That said, It will fall more if the market crashes in the short term. I have taken a small position and I will be happy to buy more if it falls below my purchase price.

9/2/20, 11:12 AM - +1 (972) 754-6465: Good
9/2/20, 11:13 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Also if Tesla goofs you the battery day, the stock will be available on huge discounts. Just my thoughts...
9/2/20, 11:13 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: *up
9/2/20, 11:16 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Expectations are too high on Battery day, and suddenly all the S&P discussions have stopped too.
9/2/20, 11:18 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: So basically nothing positive in next couple of weeks. However, if Elon releases some breakthrough battery technology on the 22nd and then the delivery reports in the last week comes near 150k, this would be rocket again
9/2/20, 11:21 AM - +1 (213) 568-8440: The way Zoom is going high almost every days,soon we may heard its split news too  😊
9/2/20, 12:00 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: SDC 20% up

9/2/20, 12:03 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: I am purchasing it with long term view
9/2/20, 12:04 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: I think in 3-4 years, this should yield good returns
9/2/20, 12:04 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: I have few, not sure to hold or sell? how is the future?
9/2/20, 12:06 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: I think it has similar strategy like Tele-Healthcare but for dental needs. It has huge market to tap into
9/2/20, 12:07 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: It also started selling few products like Toothbrush/toothpaste in Walmart just to build the brand
9/2/20, 12:07 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: In long haul, I believe there business should grow.
9/2/20, 12:08 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: So I am accumulating it bit by bit
9/2/20, 12:12 PM - +1 (857) 225-0175: profit booking by big players?
9/2/20, 12:29 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Is Tesla a good buy right now?
9/2/20, 1:01 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: 👍👍👍

9/2/20, 5:17 PM - Niteen: I need someone to explain what happened today? 😅😂 The market is all over the place.. Dow and S&P all time high.. TSLA and ZM tanked.. other growth stocks also went sideways
9/2/20, 5:19 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: markets are random right now. Everything is off its valuation. stocks with strong narratives are moving violently up and down. We are in Casino.
9/2/20, 5:19 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: If you dont invest, your $ values will get butchered by Fed inflation.
9/2/20, 5:20 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: If you invest, you are exposed to unknown levels of risk.
9/2/20, 5:22 PM - Niteen: So, considering Head and Tail game..if HEAD I lose and if TAIL you win 😂
9/2/20, 5:25 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Inflation happens over the period but market crash happens immediately
9/2/20, 5:26 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Hope you are referring head as market and cash as tail
9/2/20, 5:29 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: inflation happens to different things at different time. Read cantilon effect. While base metals and food prices went up to pre-covid levels, lumber just rocketed. Same with stocks and healthcare, rocketed.
9/2/20, 5:45 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If only market can move up in a straight line, all of us would have been billionaires. Its ok for the stocks to go sideways or even pullback after a monster rally.

9/2/20, 7:44 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: If you consider Tesla as car company then no one can justify the price of the stock.
But if you consider it as a tech company which is just happen to put it’s amazing technology in the car as a first product then it’s justifiable
9/2/20, 7:52 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Agree and still continue in innovation. So future with Tesla
9/2/20, 7:53 PM - Niteen: Agree with car company comment...we have Ford trading at 6..
9/2/20, 7:54 PM - Niteen: But Tesla still a car company..but I guess the market sentiment is lil different bcoz of other sci-fi projects such as SpaceX..
9/2/20, 7:55 PM - Niteen: Basically ppl view Tesla differently..

9/3/20, 7:54 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: These are supposed to be jokes..

9/3/20, 12:44 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: A trend that I have seen so far with Tesla is that it re-gains its peak, might take weeks or months but it does attain that. Good opportunity to gain 20% in a short span of time.
9/3/20, 12:46 PM - Niteen: 👍

9/3/20, 12:51 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Some analyst gave a target of $87 as well for Tesla.... these are shorts and badly burnt, showing there mere frustration. I am a Tesla bull so might be biased but Looking at current situation I don’t think Tesla would go to these levels, I might be wrong though
9/3/20, 12:51 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Experts in this group might have different thoughts on this .. they can certainly explain if those number to be trusted or not
9/3/20, 12:52 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: This message was deleted
9/3/20, 12:53 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: $87 might be too low and possibly wrong
9/3/20, 12:53 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: With battery day ahead and then delivery numbers to come out in the last week. Also, if S&P inclusion happens than god only save these shorts ...
9/3/20, 1:44 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Those are shorts seller and creating panic in market for mass sell
9/3/20, 1:45 PM - +1 (224) 829-8518: Is INO a good buy?

9/3/20, 5:02 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Slightly off topic (certainly from Tesla 😉) - does anyone know of effects of disclosing parent’s green card status to a bank in India? On pension and in other ways?
9/3/20, 5:25 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: GC should not impact as long as he has Indian passport, PAN & Aadhar
9/3/20, 5:26 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: I know someone who is retired IAS officer, Now US citizen and still getting pension in india
9/3/20, 5:30 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Got it at 398 in after hours. My 1st AH trade 😄. Thx for the tip Anand.

9/3/20, 5:39 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Thanks a lot 👌🏼👌🏼
9/3/20, 5:40 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: GC may be ok but wouldn’t entry exit stamps on Indian passport alert the bank that the pensioner is staying outside india?
9/3/20, 5:45 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: For Pension, they don’t look for passport. They want life certificate every year ( November)
9/3/20, 5:45 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: It’s a biometric process

9/3/20, 6:43 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Ok thanks. I have a friend in concern and his bigger worry is -
Banks in India will know you are a GC holder and will disclose financial details to US under FATCA.
Then what happens to his medical coverage in US which is due to parent dont have wealth (banks accounts) so need to be a dependent?

9/3/20, 6:44 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Great doc.... surprised not to see reliance in here, I am heavily invested in reliance partly paid and already up 50%+. I think reliance has suddenly became a growth company from a traditional petro chemical value company. In next 3-5 years it would hit 5 digits, with government in his pocket I am relying high on Mukesh Ambani.
9/3/20, 6:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I agree Reliance is becoming a turnaround story. Jim is a very valuable asset that will offset the headwind from petrochemicals

9/3/20, 7:08 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Ya reliance is giving a tough time even to Amazon, Jeff Bezos is going to miss on Indian pie the way he missed on China. With so many acquisitions and partnerships recently, Reliance has the right ammunition, if they execute them well, Ambani’s might become the richest in the world. Being a shareholder I will also gain some of their wealth 😜.
9/3/20, 7:13 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Sometimes after markets are completely different than premarket/market openings next day. Trump has his eyes on the market, this is the only asset he has left with , he will do his best to save it, it would be interesting tomorrow. Till elections he will not let the market tank to March levels.
9/3/20, 7:16 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: lol Trump just mentioned market will be sky high

it went down today because few took profits and somebody said something stupid

9/3/20, 8:46 PM - +1 (773) 364-0061: ?
9/3/20, 8:46 PM - +1 (773) 364-0061: for 4-6 months timelines
9/3/20, 8:49 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Agreed
9/3/20, 8:49 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: I would say any stock when it’s at rock bottom 😀
9/3/20, 8:49 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: But that one should have potential to move up 😃😃
9/3/20, 8:50 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: Rock bottom means only way it will go is up. People are making money in penny stocks also
9/3/20, 8:51 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Any travel industry stock. From bottom to top travel industry stock will move in 4-6 months
9/3/20, 8:53 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: Unless a company goes bust it will be good to invest when market drops further in coming days. Best way to know if company will survive is to see how much cash they have. Apple has plenty😀
9/3/20, 8:53 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Agreed I have UA, AA at bottom price
9/3/20, 9:20 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I am not a financial advisor but would tell you what I did with my 3k that I was ok to lose. I invested in workhorse, I see huge potential in them in near future. Please do some research on them and put your money their if you are ok to lose 50-60% of it if things doesn’t work out. Workhorse is into last mile delivery trucks and they are constantly innovating. There is a huge contract from USPS, which they are bidding for and if they win you will hit the jackpot, and if they lose it, your money would be less than half within few minutes as they have gained 700% in June itself. Please do due diligence before investing in it and once convinced than only put your money there.

9/3/20, 9:26 PM - +1 (205) 535-5323: TESLA still a good buy ? Or wait for some me more time ?
9/3/20, 9:32 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: You never know when it will bounce back. I would suggest to keep buying in small quantities. 
If it will go further low then you can Avg it.

Read between the lines and connect the dots...

In 2017, despite GM's plans to close the Lordstown Ohio car assembly plant, President Trump promised the workers in person that jobs would be returning to the area.

In March 2019, GM closed the plant.

In May 2019, Trump announced on Twitter a plan to reopen the Lordstown plant and rehire American workers.

In November 2019, a new company, Lordstown Motors, purchased the closed plant from GM.

In April of this year, Trump named Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager, to the council advising him on the economic response to the pandemic.

In June, Vice President Mike Pence attended the unveiling of the repurposed Lordstown plant by Lordstown Motors.  Workhorse owns 10% of Lordstown Motors.

In July, Blackrock notified the SEC that it had purchased over 3 million shares of Workhorse stock in the quarter ending June 30.

The USPS is planning to announce new contracts for up to $6.3 billion worth of new postal vehicles to replace the aging Grumman vehicles they currently use. Awards are expected by the end of the year.

Workhorse is a strong contender for at least part of the USPS contract. The other contenders include the North American arm of Indian conglomerate Mahindra; Karsan, a Turkish commercial vehicle manufacturer working with Michigan-based Morgan Olson; and a team of Oshkosh and Ford.

Did someone say, "Buy American"?  Workhouse and Oshkosh / Ford are the only all-American bidders. 

The first presidential debate is on September 29.  In Ohio.  Ohio is considered a must win state for Trump.  He won it in 2016 with just 51.69% of the vote. 

I'll be watching for big news for Workhorse ... on or just before September 29.

9/8/20, 1:26 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Then you burn hydrogen to power vehicle.
9/8/20, 1:26 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It produces water as residue.
9/8/20, 1:26 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Why not use electricity directly?

9/8/20, 6:06 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: In the meantime, what is your view in those two weeks? Will further go down so wait for a couple of week to buy OR buy now?
9/8/20, 6:16 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I don’t have the crystal ball buddy 😁, if I say that the stock will go down further and it takes off tomorrow you will lose on opportunity. No one can predict lowest levels or the peak, but if you are planning to make an entry, please do position buying in phases on the dips, so that your average remains close to the lowest.
9/8/20, 6:19 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Tesla Ke....

9/8/20, 6:22 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: no clue where it will stop 🤣🤣
9/8/20, 6:24 PM - Niteen: Like a zipline..🤣
9/8/20, 6:25 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I think it will go under $200. If not in near term, in medium to long term for sure
9/8/20, 6:25 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Before the split news, it was trading at 1375, I guess it might drop till there, I.e  around 275 as per current rates
9/8/20, 6:26 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: That would be nice. I am big Tesla supporter. But valuations are still too high.

9/8/20, 8:11 PM - +1 (408) 718-6359: Observed .. volatility index is just 2% up today even with big market selloff.. this is something crazy 🤔🤔
9/8/20, 8:13 PM - +1 (480) 252-1728: Fun fact: when Apple had Teslas current market cap (~$307 billion) they had about $40 billion in net income. Tesla has less than $1 billion.
9/8/20, 8:33 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: Tesla have solid support at 274.
9/8/20, 8:36 PM - +1 (773) 364-0061: what abt apple and msft.any support level for them?

9/8/20, 8:45 PM - +1 (419) 215-2329: Then what is the reason for crash? Is it temporary for couple of days or long term 🐻?
9/8/20, 8:48 PM - Niteen: No one knows..IMO it's going to be like this until election and then probably bubble bust..
9/8/20, 9:16 PM - +1 (419) 215-2329: Correct.
9/8/20, 10:38 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: Thats interesting, however days range was pretty much 20%

I guess now reliance retail is going the Jio route too.... the stock ran 150+ today on the rumour itself, might go up by 300+ once it gets executed.

9/10/20, 11:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: While they have impressive people on their team and board and believe their technology is/will be miles ahead from today EV batteries, at the end of the day what they have is a prototype. The production will start in 2025, and there wouldn't be any meaningful revenue until 2026-27. Until that time, like a clinical stage biotechnology company, the stock will run on hopium  (progress of assembling production lines, refining the prototype and a whole box of wax). I shy away from speculative companies, so I will look at it in a few years, assessing what they say today hold water tomorrow.
9/10/20, 11:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: My 2 cent as an investor. Offcourse many will have fantastic trade opportunities (both long and short) from time to time.

9/11/20, 7:47 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: I think its on 10/14
9/11/20, 7:47 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Sorry it’s 14 oct not 14 sept
9/11/20, 8:04 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: Out of curiosity, 
How many times this earnings play with options works well, especially with strike price ~10% OTM from current price and expiry is less than 2 weeks ?
9/11/20, 8:05 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: I tried few but i did not have satisfactory results
9/11/20, 8:06 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: Just want to know if anything i was missing
9/11/20, 8:56 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: There is no affirmative answer but it depends on how much returns you expect and come out from trade. Also many times what the info/news is coming against the earnings also made it important to go. I don’t chase all of the earnings that too in this choppy market. So far my experience was ok but the moment i am greedy, lost the money.
9/11/20, 9:01 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: Great, thanks for sharing, i had similar experience, some time multifold and sometime down to 0 😀.
9/11/20, 9:02 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: One thing in shorteer expiry n far otm over earnings is IV , which drops drastically post earnings and eats most gain
9/11/20, 9:02 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: True zero 😄

9/13/20, 4:52 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: What the way to buy a IPO price? SNOW have maker hype and chance to shoot up.
9/13/20, 5:09 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: Unity bhi sahi hai.
 SumoLogic ka product thoda common sa hai🤣🤣
9/13/20, 5:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It will be wishful thinking to get SNOW at the IPO price at least on Day 1, particularly as they have an agreement to sell it to the father of value investing at that price. 

Berkshire and Salesforce commitment will probably set a floor in the market at least for short to medium term. The only hope is for market to crash in the hope get access to it.
9/13/20, 5:17 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Do you still think that will further crash?
9/13/20, 5:17 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Market*
9/13/20, 5:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Don't know, the charts do not look good, 3250 give or take for S&P seems to be a reasonable place to visit
9/13/20, 5:22 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Yup, market not corrected yet. Either next week or next month otherwise after election
9/13/20, 5:22 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: 3250 is too far. Doesn't look like it will come but good for investors if it will visit.
9/13/20, 5:23 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Election is just a hype. It won't correct this big no matter who will win.
9/13/20, 5:24 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Hmm, real virus issue did not reflect in market yet and its due. When market correct, it will down to any limit..
9/13/20, 5:25 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
9/13/20, 5:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Lets complete the thought. If you are a long term investor and get around the IPO price, this has the potential to be one of the top stocks in your portfolio. It will be compounder for years to come for three reasons 

- Massive TAM and revenue growth potential for digital world
- Lootman (CEO) is a visionary and is know for exponentially growing ServiceNow (14x growth)
- It has the best growth metrics in the street and can be compared with Zoom, Crowdstrike and Shopify of the world. These 3 are my highest conviction stocks that I had participated from the very early days.  

In short the hype is real.
9/13/20, 6:12 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Also, as it runs on all the three major public cloud vendors(AWS, Azure and Google cloud) it looks like a promising investment opportunity.

9/13/20, 7:06 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: May be crash too. So be ready for both direction

9/13/20, 8:55 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Good news for Oracle and FSLY stock tomorrow.. Oracle has been stuck in range for a very long time.. Hopefully it comes and hits it's 52 week high again tomorrow.

9/13/20, 8:56 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Why good for FSLY? Oracle has its own cloud business
9/13/20, 9:15 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: fsly has 16% main business coming from tiktok. From the time, the deal us operations deadlock was announced from China, stock was under some pressure. Hopefully, tomorrow it should be relieved.
9/13/20, 9:23 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Nvidia to buy Arm Holdings from SoftBank for $40 billion
https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/nvidia-to-buy-arm-holdings-from-softbank-for-40-billion.html
9/13/20, 9:28 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 12% of the revenue is from Tiktok, and its almost half from US operations so roughly 6%. Stock has already fallen 35% from its high, part of the reason because it went up too high too fast. 

Any price between $50 (worst case price if market crashes) to $75 should be a good level for long term.
9/13/20, 9:29 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: 👍🏻
9/13/20, 9:29 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: Good info. Thanks
9/13/20, 9:31 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Those are cloud ..
9/13/20, 9:58 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Oracle can provide TikTok with cloud infrastructure, although the company is not a leader in that market.
9/13/20, 10:13 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Look like it’s bid price war and Microsoft refuse to increase bid price. I don’t think, Oracle alone can buy the business and it only there to make bid price high
9/13/20, 10:14 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Interesting next 2-3 days
9/13/20, 10:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Tiktok news is over-rated for Fastly IMO. As I said US operations is only 6% of Fastly revenue. The market is also not giving credit to Fastly's signal science acquisition which will be accretive in the long run.
9/13/20, 10:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Anyways the drama will be over sooner than later!
9/13/20, 10:27 PM - +1 (203) 344-8258: We already implemented it and now using it. So far it is good.

9/13/20, 10:59 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Snowflake is a strong competitor for AWS Redshift. Latest Redshift offering actually copied some features from Snowflake. So long term, it’s a confirmed winner.
9/14/20, 7:55 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Increased from $75-$85 to $100-$110 today morning. They are not leaving any money on the table and its getting expensive.

9/14/20, 12:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: We discussed Novocure sometime back and it was categorized as Tortoise/Turtle 🐢 by another holder of stock. 

I am ok with that categorization as long as it generate 60% return in less than 2 months, particularly in a choppy market. Its close to all time high and really done well when many of the most popular stocks have lagged, despite most money flowing into those stocks. Let talk returns - 

S&P: 5.5%
Apple: ~25%
Tesla: ~35%
Tortoise: ~60%

:-)
9/14/20, 12:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Btw fastly is up 7%, as I said Fastly has already got more than its share of beating.

9/14/20, 5:30 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Lots of ups and down, might give perfect opportunity to make some quick bucks, post battery day by month end or early next month the delivery numbers will come and if they hit 150k stock will again go up. And then the earnings call, Tesla keeps the excitement on
9/14/20, 5:31 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: The companies broke ground on the project on July 21, and expect to have it up and charged to capacity by early 2021, and "fully operational" by the second quarter of 2021.
9/14/20, 5:32 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: So hype will be continue in 2021 too

9/15/20, 7:44 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: Snowflake is slated to go public on Wednesday, September 16. It has currently set its pricing range at $75-$85 per share, which would give the company a $22.3 billion valuation at the midpoint of that range.
9/15/20, 7:45 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: 16th wednesday

9/15/20, 12:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍Always good to be cautious and it would be great to get another correction. That said I think folks will benefit buying a dip when that happens rather than selling it. 

We are in a bull market!
9/15/20, 12:52 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: These r spac. They r called blank cheque companies

9/15/20, 1:38 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Did they come out with kids apple watch?
9/15/20, 1:38 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: That will be huge
9/15/20, 2:08 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Yes .. kind off .. it’s a cheaper watch with family setup control ..
9/15/20, 2:09 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: That might spike sale and ultimately the stock price.. isn’t it?
9/15/20, 2:11 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Does it make sense to sell the stocks that are in 30%+ profit right now and re-enter once the market falls again (based on the guess)?
9/15/20, 2:12 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: If market falls, we would loose current profit
9/15/20, 2:13 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: * Thinking from short term perspective 6-8 months horizon vs long term investment
9/15/20, 2:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its tough to time the market. If you are trading, sure you can lock profits, but the market may not give you a chance and keep running higher and deprive you additional profits you would have made if you would have been in the market.
9/15/20, 2:50 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: One way to handle this is to lock a portion of profit and let the other run higher. If market falls, you average, if it goes higher you continue selling and not be greedy.

9/15/20, 9:19 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: This specific SPAC is merging with Hyliion.This is a competitor of Nikola and Tesla.It has the least 7 year ownership cost out of all of them.It also has the best chance against competing with Tesla in the Class 8 truck market with providing companies with hybrid solutions as well as in production their own Hypertruck ERX.Hope this helped clarify some of your questions.

9/16/20, 1:58 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Last week, Snowflake revealed in a filing that Berkshire Hathaway and Salesforce each agreed to buy $250 million of stock at the IPO price in a concurrent private placement. Berkshire Hathaway also agreed to buy 4.04 million shares in a secondary transaction from former CEO Bob Muglia. Based on the IPO price, Berkshire will be paying $484.8 million for those shares.
9/16/20, 1:58 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: This is main reason of market hype of SNOW
9/16/20, 6:51 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I discussed this here, but you elaborated it further.
9/16/20, 6:52 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And not to mention its a fantastic company
9/16/20, 6:54 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: When I say IPO price above it meant $75-$85. Offcourse that has changed and increased a couple of times, and I dont think we will reach there.
9/16/20, 9:27 AM - Niteen: <Media omitted>
9/16/20, 9:30 AM - +1 (773) 364-0061: too high
9/16/20, 9:31 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I looked at popular IPO's of some of the best companies and in most cases, price either come back to test the opening price and in some cases go below it, 3-6 mos later.
9/16/20, 9:33 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I think this is an exceptional company, but I am hoping we will get opportunities when the hype goes away and/or during market dislocation.
9/16/20, 9:33 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Keeping an eye on this.
9/16/20, 10:12 AM - Niteen: Agree, opening is too high..I'll come back to it later once it settles down a bit for long term investment
9/16/20, 10:53 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: At what price it makes sense to enter?
9/16/20, 10:59 AM - +1 (917) 862-4382: Snowflake IPO indicated at 165$ -170$ opening.
9/16/20, 11:00 AM - +1 (860) 986-8967: Snow to open around 180$
JFrog- 80$
9/16/20, 11:04 AM - Lalmani BJANA: Can we buy put in that case?
9/16/20, 11:28 AM - +1 (609) 216-4502: Nash, very good insight. I think the drop also has to do with systematic dumping by original underwriters and loosening of sale restrictions on IPO employees.
9/16/20, 11:29 AM - Niteen: 👍
9/16/20, 11:37 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍 Yep, expiration of lockup plus normal market volatility that gives us opportunity from time to time. 

One thing I am sure that we also have some stable hands in this company that will be with it for a very long time (Berkshire and Salesforce)

9/16/20, 12:13 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: Yes
9/16/20, 12:40 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: <Media omitted>
9/16/20, 12:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ha ha
9/16/20, 12:41 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Wow
9/16/20, 12:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: As I said, wishful thinking to get at the IPO price
9/16/20, 12:41 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Wow!!!!! 85 to 100 to 120 to 276...
9/16/20, 12:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Anyways wait and watch
9/16/20, 12:43 PM - Niteen: 😂👍
9/16/20, 12:43 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Was IPO at 270?
9/16/20, 12:43 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: No
9/16/20, 12:44 PM - Niteen: No, It opened 156 above or 130% up..it's all hyped.
9/16/20, 12:44 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Oh ok thanks
9/16/20, 12:45 PM - Niteen: It's already 300+ 😂 racing away..
9/16/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Will come down, hopefully 😄
9/16/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not coming to $120 😔
9/16/20, 12:47 PM - +1 (408) 242-5192: Crazy opening price but fantastic day for employees... opening champagnes 🍾
9/16/20, 12:47 PM - Niteen: Yes..it must .let's see..
9/16/20, 12:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And early investors
9/16/20, 12:51 PM - +1 (419) 215-2329: Halted now
9/16/20, 12:54 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: Snow has taken away limelight from all other stocks
9/16/20, 12:56 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: unbelievable
9/16/20, 12:57 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: amazon redshift ka duplicate hai snowflake
9/16/20, 12:57 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: aur kuch jyada usp nahi hai
9/16/20, 12:59 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: ye dusra Tesla hai kya
9/16/20, 1:00 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: One of the theories coming up was snow is using aws infrastructure to provide services. Considering amazon strategy in the past it can easily kill snow learning what it is doing on aws
9/16/20, 1:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: What Slootman was able to do in 6 years in ServiceNow, he is able to do in Day 1 here. Service Now had 1.3 bn in revenue in 2017 and the company had a market cap of $25bn. Snowflake had $500mm in revenue but valued at $75bn based on current price
9/16/20, 1:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 2017 is when he left service now
9/16/20, 1:00 PM - +1 (732) 331-3713: Multi cloud and niche features(whether you use it or not) is their biggest selling point
9/16/20, 1:02 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: my brother works in AWS, as per him, AWS redshift offers feature to feature and offers better pricing for cloud+software combo.
9/16/20, 1:03 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: lets see how long madness lasts
9/16/20, 1:03 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/16/snowflakes-ties-to-amazon-are-a-risk-as-investors-prepare-for-ipo.html
9/16/20, 1:03 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Again just a theory
9/16/20, 1:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Why it is better? 

- Its cloud agnostic and works with all major 3 providers, which is essential to survive in a multi-cloud world 
- Faster insights, organized repositories, use both structure and unstructured data 
- bifurcation of compute and storage optimizing the cost for customers
- user friendly, seamless data sharing, scalability etc

This is a better mousetrap, however the question is whether it would be able to grow the revenue faster than the services it uses from other providers.
9/16/20, 1:14 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: We use snowflake and amazon both... we stuck with snowflake for many reasons instead of aws
9/16/20, 1:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I dobt have a tech background, but there is a reason its growing as a weed. 

The market for data warehouse as a service is expected to grow ~30% for next 5-10 yrs, which is phenomenal and will be a tailwind for it for years to come, but I dont want to fight with valuations which is ridiculous at this time, so will wait for a better entry point.
9/16/20, 1:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍
9/16/20, 1:18 PM - Niteen: Actually other way around..amazon copied features of snowflake..
9/16/20, 1:20 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Coming down... under $200
9/16/20, 1:20 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: May be good to enter
9/16/20, 1:20 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: ?
9/16/20, 1:20 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: hum to 120 ka wait kar rahe hai 😊
9/16/20, 1:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: :-)
9/16/20, 1:21 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Phir hum bhi yahi karte hai
9/16/20, 1:22 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: But if it come to $120 that means issue and will go under $100
9/16/20, 1:22 PM - Niteen: 75 🙂
9/16/20, 1:22 PM - +1 (224) 422-2950: What about Apple
9/16/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: will Avg then
9/16/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: however chances are less
9/16/20, 1:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not reaching $120, we will know as time progresses and charts develop
9/16/20, 1:25 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: copy-paste is two way street. Pretty common in software industry. Point is what customer pays and if featureset meets requirements.
9/16/20, 1:27 PM - Niteen: Not denying copy paste model.. but Amazon is great at destroying local players and killing local merchants..too much cash flow. They should be sued and questioned on how they share and use their partners IPs and other biz critical information.
9/16/20, 1:29 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: yes, amzn is doing that since 2000s. You can definitely support snowflake in your jihad against Amazon. But we want to make money at end of the day 🙂
9/16/20, 1:31 PM - Niteen: Jihad 😂..wrong context. Everyone here wants to make money but should know about biz practice too..
9/16/20, 1:32 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Big players always do that..aapl trying to destroy pton
9/16/20, 1:35 PM - +1 (202) 640-9499: I myself compared Snowflake and Redshift and currently use in my application. I see snowflake has some advantage in pricing with Redshift but I don't exactly remember the strategy. Major win for Snowflake that it is cloud agnostic. We have some customers(fortune 10) who don't want their data to be hosted in AWS. We were forced to use Azure or GCP but then we don't want to stick with a specific data warehouse cloud solution. Snowflake came here as a great solution where you can spun up an instance in Azure, AWS, GCP.  Even though your data is scattered in multiple clouds ,regions but then Snowflake has a feature where you can bring them together run your analysis and destroy. This gives a huge win for analytics need. Another case such as GDPR compliance where we cannot bring data outside of Europe and Snowflake help to load/stitch the data from different region and allow us to run the analysis. These are some of the big advantages I noted before making a decision over Snowflake and many more as other stated. Hope this helps others for their analysis.

Same with Amazon, it is all consuming machine. 1000s of business categories disrupted; shareholders see that as righeous war to provide best service to customer;; small businesses it is persecution and murder.
9/16/20, 1:38 PM - Niteen: Wow...that was quite a lesson..I'll just stop here and focus back to market. Thanks.
9/16/20, 1:39 PM - +1 (202) 640-9499: One important thing is Snowflake has open policy. Any point of time if you think to shift from Snowflake then you can easily extract data but other solutions doesn't support it or allow it.
9/16/20, 1:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Thanks, In-line with what my research shows.
9/16/20, 1:45 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: good points. However, multi-cloud is not new. Rackspace, IBM, Netapp, Nutanix, literally dozens of players in multi-cloud offering overlapping services.
9/16/20, 1:46 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I can understand better services and pricing, however is it sustainable or can be augmented in future?
9/16/20, 1:50 PM - +1 (202) 640-9499: Not sure if any of them offers what snowflake has by remaining inside the cloud (ex aws and Azure)
9/16/20, 1:52 PM - +1 (202) 640-9499: Nothing is sustainable in tech industry 😂. Things always change
9/16/20, 1:56 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: *The Fed's two-day meeting, beginning today, concludes Wednesday with a policy statement at 2 p.m. and Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m.*
9/16/20, 1:57 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: i guess 2 pm EST,, so in 3 mins
9/16/20, 1:58 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: yes
9/16/20, 2:00 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: This is excellent!! Thanks @12026409499 !
9/16/20, 2:00 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: *FED LEAVES RATES NEAR ZERO, FORECASTS SHOW ON HOLD THROUGH 2023
9/16/20, 2:02 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: FED TO KEEP RATES NEAR ZERO UNTIL ACHIEVE MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT
9/16/20, 2:02 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: money will keep flowing till we arent back to full employment or inflation doesnt shoot notch over 2%
9/16/20, 2:02 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Set for moderate overshoot
9/16/20, 2:03 PM - +1 (202) 640-9499: Welcome 🙂
9/16/20, 2:35 PM - Niteen: 👍 This is very much aligned with what my experience also. I still remember last summer when snowflake folks came and did a  demo for us..it was clearly a winner by far at that time as no other vendors had similar capabilities. Cost definitely a factor when it comes to tech decision making but snowflakes DWH capabilities (cloud agnostic was major one) and features were far superior in cloud space..obviously leadership chose to go with it.
9/16/20, 3:26 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: MRNA, NVAX all going up for last 5 days

9/16/20, 3:50 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: $2600
9/16/20, 3:51 PM - Niteen: In anticipation of battery day Sep 22
9/16/20, 3:51 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: yes
9/16/20, 3:52 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Ahhh  i see, my options are expiring this week
9/16/20, 3:52 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: So either zoom or doom
9/16/20, 3:52 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Lets see
9/16/20, 3:57 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: keep it
9/16/20, 3:58 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: tomorrow may be good move
9/16/20, 4:03 PM - +1 (732) 799-8114: 👍
9/16/20, 5:36 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Be sure what to wish for. If Dems win market will, and I allege, “over correct” by this terminology.
9/16/20, 5:45 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Then why BRK-B is not rising?
9/16/20, 5:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Absolutely sure with what I had asked for. Presidential election have  minimal impact on overall returns on longer term timeframes. Infact, markets have almost performed 2x better under democrat than other republican regime. If we correct (over-correct as the case may be), that would be the last buying opportunity, and I am ready for that.
9/16/20, 5:50 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Continue to emphasize that we are in a bull market.
9/16/20, 5:52 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: This assertion depends on buyer’s timeframe. The term “longer term” is subjective.
If you’re long term investor like I am, buy core stocks on Dem dip or any other dip and hold for 20 / 40 years for insane profits
9/16/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Considering that we're in 5th leg, would that be an abrupt end to this bull market?
9/16/20, 6:03 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yes Nikunj, I will be holding my stocks as long as the story doesn't change. I dont want to be fixated on time frame, because I want to be flexible enough to change allocation given where we are in the market cycle.
9/16/20, 6:04 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The bull market has just 5 months old. If history is a guide, we are atleast a couple to few years away from an abrupt ending.
9/16/20, 6:07 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: March fall is not end of 4th leg? Do you see it as end of last bull market?
9/16/20, 6:07 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: I'm thinking that this is the 5th leg of the bull market that started in 2009
9/16/20, 6:07 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The 5th leg would need to complete an impulsive 5 phase in the northern direction. Seems like we have completed Phase 1 at 3600, and are current experiencing Phase 2 downtrend of Phase 5.
9/16/20, 6:07 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Phase 4 completed on March 22nd
9/16/20, 6:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Btw I divide my portfolio in core stocks that provide stability and compound for years (Amazon, Microsoft, Mastercard) and explosive growth stocks (Fastly, Zoom, Shopify, Crowdstrike etc).During a correction, I allocate more towards the later to generate significant alpha. Feel free to keep an eye on my stocks and their performance that I discuss here from time to time, almost all of which have significantly outperformed the market. I wish you luck in your approach.

9/16/20, 8:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Depending on your risk profile, you can start with 50-50 and allocate up and down depending on your volatility you are able to bear from day to day.
9/16/20, 9:01 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: 👍🏻

I don’t see any  bad news about Microsoft not sure why it’s going down
9/17/20, 9:44 AM - Niteen: Yes, buy the dip for long term 👍
9/17/20, 9:45 AM - +1 (732) 208-1574: 👍
9/17/20, 10:00 AM - Niteen: Anyone holding JD here? Any thoughts?
9/17/20, 10:02 AM - +1 (702) 832-9445: Same like msft. Good to buy for long term. It’ll see a hike with 11/11.
9/17/20, 10:03 AM - +1 (702) 832-9445: Anyone following Etsy?
9/17/20, 10:05 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: I have a small position in JD. They appear well positioned for long term. They have a good business model and investing heavily in modernizing their supply chain. I think all this is going to help them in long term. And I hope it reflects in their share prices.
9/17/20, 10:06 AM - +1 (205) 535-5323: AAPL good time to buy now? It’s at 110.
9/17/20, 10:06 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: I am waiting under $100
9/17/20, 10:06 AM - +1 (813) 476-1612: Under 100 is a good deal

9/17/20, 10:44 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Anyone know about company working in “electric car battery recycling”
9/17/20, 10:45 AM - Niteen: 👍I also have some and planning to add more for long term.
9/17/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Private one I know. J b straubel founded one in Nevada
9/17/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: How to buy the stock of private one?
9/17/20, 10:46 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Call him on phone
9/17/20, 10:50 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I own Etsy, its a speciality e-commerce player for creative an unique products. I got in at $40 and have a full position, but this is a great stock with long term tailwinds.
9/17/20, 11:20 AM - +1 (702) 832-9445: Thanks Nash. Recently it came under some hammer due to fb marketplace. Just wanted to get a perspective to move out or hold
9/17/20, 11:58 AM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Apple is not going down from 110$
9/17/20, 12:08 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: Check STLHF - explores for, develops, and processes lithium brine properties in the United States. The company's flagship project is the Lanxess project where it operates approximately 150,000 acres of brine leases, which is located in southern Arkansas. TMRC. an exploration stage mining company, acquires, explores, and develops mineral properties in the United States. It primarily holds interests in the Round Top rare earth-uranium-beryllium project covering 950 acres in Hudspeth County, Texas; and prospecting permits covering 9,345 acres adjacent to the Round Top project.
9/17/20, 12:09 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: These are OTC stocks but recently there was movement in these because they own properties is there future in these stocks
9/17/20, 12:20 PM - +1 (510) 240-0824: AAPL is 109 now
9/17/20, 12:32 PM - Niteen: Nice info, thanks for sharing 👍 will definitely explore it.
9/17/20, 12:35 PM - Niteen: Yeah, looks like ppl shorting AAPL and MSFT.. dragging DOW again to red
9/17/20, 1:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: At this point of time I have no reason to believe that any other player is eating Etsy's lunch. Some of the highlights for their results as I recall

1. Active buyers and sellers increased between 35-40%
2. Revenue and GMV increased more than 130%
3. Investors were concerned about the growth has been due to mask sales, which will eventually go away. That said non mask sales were up 90%
4. The average spend of repeat customers on Etsy is all time high and increasing every year
5. Most wall street analyst are bullish on the stock with an average price target if $150

If you are a long term investor, I would hold Etsy is years to come and accumulate over time. If you are a trader, you can book profit, but given the decline we had from $140, I am not sure how low will it go. All depends on market, but they have a lot of support on their charts underneath.
9/17/20, 1:39 PM - +1 (702) 832-9445: Thanks Nash!!

9/18/20, 10:58 AM - Niteen: AMZN is in a good range..keep tracking and get some for long term. It will bounce back soon..
9/18/20, 10:58 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: MSFT is good to buy now i think..
9/18/20, 11:00 AM - +1 (201) 850-0875: Going in phases/SIP will be helpful as finding a bottom is bit challenging especially during such volatility.
9/18/20, 11:00 AM - Niteen: Yes..dont think it will go below 200.. both MSFT and AMZN looks like good buy for long term.
9/18/20, 11:01 AM - +1 (702) 832-9445: 🙏

9/18/20, 11:55 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Don't know yet. Have to wait for charts to develop. That said, based on valuation, if it reaches around $150, it should be an excellent point for long term hold.
9/18/20, 11:56 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The risk is it doesb not reach. I will post in this group when I execute.
9/18/20, 11:56 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Well hope it comes sooner 🙂
9/18/20, 11:56 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👍🏻. Will wait.
9/18/20, 11:57 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I did a small add to my already full position yesterday at 860
9/18/20, 11:57 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Any idea on DraftKings. It has been on run this week. Should I cash out?
9/18/20, 11:58 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Hi Nash, what is a full position
9/18/20, 11:59 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Say you have 30 stock in your portfolio, each stock is 3.33%
9/18/20, 11:59 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: which represent a full position
9/18/20, 12:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: That said, all stocks should not be weighed equally
9/18/20, 12:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Given you have high conviction and low conviction ideas
9/18/20, 12:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So I double it 6.5%
9/18/20, 12:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Which can be seen as a full position
9/18/20, 12:02 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Assuning a 30 stock portfolio, I will not put more than 6.5% of my capital in any given position
9/18/20, 12:03 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: So you generally distribute stocks equally, and then increase the investment on the ones which you anticipate to go higher?
9/18/20, 12:04 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah sort of
9/18/20, 12:04 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I add only when its at support. Offcourse the support can break, then I look at my next support and get even more greedy.
9/18/20, 12:06 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: In that case if a stock gains significantly higher which was of smaller position in your portfolio what do you do. 
I am asking because my smallest position in workhorse has almost doubled in last couple of weeks, should I increase the position or book some profit
9/18/20, 12:07 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I let my winners run. To determine its a winner, I look at quarterly performance
9/18/20, 12:07 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So 6% can one day become 15%
9/18/20, 12:07 PM - Niteen: 👍
9/18/20, 12:08 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I dont invest in pre-revenue companies
9/18/20, 12:09 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So you might need to track, how close they are in building their factory, developing prototype, production etx
9/18/20, 12:09 PM - Niteen: That's what I'm doing today .. still adjusting 🤣
9/18/20, 12:09 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So cannot recommend on workhorse
9/18/20, 12:10 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Got it, thanks as always
9/18/20, 12:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I would definitely nit add at all time high
9/18/20, 12:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: $22-$23 is a good support
9/18/20, 12:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: One strategy is book partial profit and keep a stop loss below this number
9/18/20, 12:14 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yaa... does make sense, I will keep holding for now with a stop loss of 23, and once my money becomes 2.5x will boom some profit
9/18/20, 12:26 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
9/18/20, 12:27 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I dont have a position and not intended to buy it
9/18/20, 12:27 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Where you track the support levels? Is this an app or website?
9/18/20, 12:28 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Tradingview
9/18/20, 12:28 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I draw my own support and resistance
9/18/20, 12:32 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Is there a charting tool which creates the support and resistance similar to indicators ..
9/18/20, 12:32 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: ?
9/18/20, 12:33 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Or we always have to crate S&R  on our own.. ?
9/18/20, 12:36 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thanks.
9/18/20, 12:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There may be, you can search the indicators in tradingview
9/18/20, 12:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I dont use any
9/18/20, 12:40 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Ok .. indicators can be added but S&R .. i have not seen in yahoo finance or trading view
9/18/20, 12:48 PM - Niteen: Which tool is this?
9/18/20, 2:20 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Aapl / msft good buy now?

9/18/20, 3:33 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: Any feedback for shopify and TTD?
9/18/20, 3:51 PM - +1 (408) 718-6359: Both are corrected more than 15% , all tech stocks are corrected.if market support these will fly🚀
9/18/20, 4:21 PM - Niteen: 👍Hope ppl finished their shopping 😀
9/18/20, 4:28 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: Is NVIDIA still a good purchase,,
9/18/20, 4:29 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I am still relatively cautious / nervous - I want to ask, should we feel bullish about the market over the next few months?
9/18/20, 4:31 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: It is difficult to say for next few months. But looking back at history, I feel you should be bullish about market over next few years.
9/18/20, 4:31 PM - +1 (408) 718-6359: As market in correction since 15 days .. I believe until mid October market will be good.. after that earning season starts.. so it’s fully dependent on ER’s and political news
9/18/20, 4:32 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: i am still cautious but buying as well in small size.
9/18/20, 4:32 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: correction stated with DIA hitting ATH and while all other indexes are closed below 50MA, DIA still holding MA50 as of today's close
9/18/20, 4:33 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: so if that is going to server as support. this should show some recovery in following week.
9/18/20, 4:33 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: serve**
9/18/20, 4:34 PM - Niteen: 👍
9/18/20, 4:43 PM - Niteen: Also, not to forget that election is just around the corner, less than 50 days away. The market is going to play a bit.
9/18/20, 4:45 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: You see, this is my main worry. It’s an ugly thing and that contaminates a lot on an otherwise sensitive (if not fragile) market 🧐
9/18/20, 4:45 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I c VCs slur all your inputs guys 🙏🏼
9/18/20, 4:52 PM - Niteen: That's the real thing (election). Does anyone remember 2016 election time..the market was driving ppl crazy.. so if there is a shake up in the oval office it will have direct impact on the market.
9/18/20, 4:54 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: This is my states worry.
Biden, wonder how good he’s overall, but is more likely to doom markets.
Trump, wonder how worthy for office, more likely to continue to pump stocks if wins.
But this cud turn opposite also.
And hence the election “dice” is a worry
9/18/20, 4:55 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Can’t forget 2016. I betted against many confident friends who shorted their entire portfolios when Trump won.
I am happy but that’s partly luck and that’s the worry
9/18/20, 4:56 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: I think in mid run market should go down both ways... Even trump once in office would then worry not, and this artificial stimulus will go away and once people starts pulling money then its domino effect...
9/18/20, 4:58 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: That’s agreeable also. It’s like “show is over” effect.
Besides, he may have nothing profound to offer to market and what he did have us already accounted for so far, in terms of economics.
9/18/20, 4:59 PM - Niteen: Yeah, Mr Trump will try everything in his capacity to pump the market, and he'll make sure that he is tweeting about it too. Then comes the 2nd part which is money printing and pumping the economy which only time will tell.
9/18/20, 8:58 PM - +1 (972) 989-0421: Asking for a friend : what’s a legal and clever way to transfer/remit large sum of money to India.

9/18/20, 9:43 PM - +1 (972) 989-0421: It’s personal.. some property transaction
9/18/20, 10:00 PM - +1 (650) 240-6540: I was looking for options just todays and looked up online, xoom, remitely together have 30 - 50k limits.

9/18/20, 10:05 PM - +1 (650) 240-6540: I too was looking for clever (efficient + better exchange rate) options but couldn't find any.
9/18/20, 10:54 PM - +1 (972) 989-0421: Right...i think money2india have 200k limit in a month
9/18/20, 10:54 PM - +1 (972) 989-0421: thanks for pointers thought

9/21/20, 5:45 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Already back to 428...
9/21/20, 5:46 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: In stock, no one 100% sure. But high chance
9/21/20, 6:30 PM - +1 (202) 640-9499: make sense...  but I was curious about the approx time which it will take to bounce back
9/21/20, 9:31 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👆if you are paying attention and watching the market here is what you'd have noticed. 

- Futures made a low of 3247 overnight. 

- Cash market filled a gap slightly lower, and flirted with 3250 a number of times.

- It closed the day making a reversal after reaching my number, reaching the minimum correction of 3250 that I had forecasted last week.
9/21/20, 9:31 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Does this mean that we are out of woods now? 

Let me put it this way. We have reached the minimum target to complete Wave 2 of 5 of the EWT. I have been buying selectively, however, most times wave 2 can be complex. Typically correction are over only after weak hands give up, which has not happened yet, so there is a reasonable probability that we go lower. If we break the low again (even after rallying), i will be providing with updated numbers. 

However once this correction gets over (may be after elections), we will start wave 3 of 5 and  will work towards my bigger picture target of minimum 4000 S&P handle that I had listed out earlier.
9/21/20, 9:42 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Some folks have also asked me what to buy. While I haven't had a chance to do a detailed write-up, here is what I had shopped that one can consider - 

New positions

Zoom at $380. I consider Zoom as one of the best stocks in the market. I did not buy a full position and looking for declines to add

Adyen at $31 - A leader in payment processing out of Europe. Be in online or app payment, terminal or retail POS, cross country remittance or e-commerce, Adyen platform provide tools and analytics for its customer. 

Docusign at average $210 - I am losing money here, but this is the leader in the e-signature and document management market. Some of you may have used it. 

Existing adds

Shopify at $860. My first investment was at $100, but am still not afraid to add here. I consider Shopify as the future Amazon. 

Crowstrike at $125. My average cost is $70. 

Datadog at $80. My average cost is $50.
9/21/20, 9:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Happy to answer if there are any questions.
9/21/20, 9:45 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Not topping up Roku after breakouts?
9/21/20, 9:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Nope, two reasons 1. My typical style is to only buy corrective waves (when stock inhale) 2. I have a full position of Roku.
9/21/20, 9:58 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Do you think Crowdstrike is good to add now or any chance it may go down further.

9/21/20, 10:20 PM - Niteen: Nice insight 👍

9/22/20, 7:50 AM - +1 (979) 587-9883 joined using this group's invite link
9/22/20, 9:07 AM - Niteen: Welcome to much hyped battery day..let's see how TSLA moves from here 😀
9/22/20, 9:44 AM - Niteen: Is NVCR still good for long term..planning to add some with the current dip..any thoughts?
9/22/20, 10:22 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Why WKHS is down?
9/22/20, 10:38 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Looks like profit booking as it has gained a lot in last couple of weeks, lot of insiders are selling.
9/22/20, 10:40 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: I thought 28 was strong support. But it was broken.
9/22/20, 10:44 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Typically, I like to add only at support, when stock is tanking or avoided which is not the case here, so there is risk to take a position

That said, $98 and $90 area are support and can be considered, only if you are in for long term.
9/22/20, 10:45 AM - Niteen: That makes sense. Thanks for the advise 👍
9/22/20, 10:52 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I am not sure if support level as I don’t understand charts, it has gained 80-90% in last 2-3 weeks, it was gaining even when whole market was going down. I guess it is normal profit booking, even their CEO sold 50k shares under 10b-5 last week, other CXOs might be selling too as they generally get compensated with stocks + fixed salary. 
On the other hand Ark invest has increased their position in the stock.
9/22/20, 10:53 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: 👍
9/22/20, 10:54 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: If you are worried that they dint get the usps contract, if that would have happened, the stock would have had a free fall😁
9/22/20, 10:55 AM - +1 (972) 754-6465: In US markets insider trading is very common like ceo cfo other executives. It is not big deal . Recently Aapl ceo sold 250 k shares before the week of split . Everyone like us buying shares for split event 😀
9/22/20, 10:57 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Correct. I am aware of that. If no usps contract. I know where the stock will land😀

9/22/20, 7:14 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: Yea one thing we have learned is that Elon knows how to keep building hype and move target dates by few years as if that’s just few days 😀

9/23/20, 12:12 AM - +1 (425) 786-5518: IBKR will increase margin requirements by as much as 35% above normal margin requirements leading up to the November U.S. election. To illustrate, consider a Reg. T margin account with stock XYZ having an Initial Margin requirement of 50% and a Maintenance Margin requirement of 25%. With the increase fully implemented, the new requirements would be 67.5% Initial and 33.75% Maintenance.
9/23/20, 12:12 AM - +1 (425) 786-5518: Sign of upcoming volatility and risk in the mkt ??!

9/23/20, 3:12 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Planning to add more Tesla at $350.

9/23/20, 3:14 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I added at 380.
9/23/20, 3:15 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Will buy more if it further dips

9/23/20, 6:06 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: So we can’t expect a march like dip?
9/23/20, 6:08 PM - +1 (917) 578-2068: What is the news to do with your question?
9/23/20, 6:08 PM - +1 (917) 578-2068: Just curious
9/23/20, 6:09 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: So people start buying more on dips, and won’t see bigger down side.
9/23/20, 6:11 PM - +1 (917) 578-2068: Got it

9/24/20, 12:37 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Good for Tesla
9/24/20, 12:52 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: Nikola dropped to 18,,  will it go further down or is it a good time to enter now
9/24/20, 12:54 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: I am still not sure if this company is even worth entering.
9/24/20, 12:54 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I am not sure why wall street folks have such a myopic view on Tesla. Is it because the stock has gained so much over last few quarters? Why they don’t see that the stock  traded in two digits for good 6-8 years. It is now when the company started registering profits quarter over quarter the stock has gained. In battery day, Elon showed his vision and the innovations he is doing, and this time he was cautious in committing something which he can’t achieve(like past). Anyways good for me as my order of 360 also got executed this morning.
9/24/20, 12:56 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: *Unlike past
9/24/20, 12:56 PM - +1 (929) 215-4132: 👍 😀
9/24/20, 12:58 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: Would rather buy NIO instead of NKLA
9/24/20, 3:53 PM - +1 (516) 653-8250: I bought ZM at 516.. going down n down.. better to sell or could be ths revert. Ne 458
9/24/20, 3:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: No one literary no one should buy stocks at all time highs, I can give 100's of example why thats a bad strategy
9/24/20, 3:56 PM - +1 (669) 235-0477: I admit! I learned from my own mistakes!
9/24/20, 3:57 PM - +1 (516) 653-8250: Thought ZM will also follow TSLA route.. so thought I shld not miss the boat ths time🤪
9/24/20, 3:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah its all about patience
9/24/20, 3:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If you are scared about a 10% decline, you will have a hard time being in the stock market
9/24/20, 3:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If you increase your time horizon (just don't look at it) and average down, you will do well in this stock
9/24/20, 4:00 PM - +1 (516) 653-8250: Ok will Thnks for advice👍
9/24/20, 4:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I will post in the group any add on to my existing position on Zoom
9/24/20, 4:14 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Perfect strategy if committed a mistake or the stock goes down post purchase, buy the dips in phases and bring the buying cost down and down if the stock continues to fall
9/24/20, 4:15 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I guess this is the way big investment firms never book losses no matter how much the stock falls, as they have loads of money they increase their position at a lower rate by 4-5times
9/24/20, 4:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Only and only if its a fundamentally good stock. If you would jave bought GE at $60, you would have continue to buy until $6 today, thats a bad strategy
9/24/20, 4:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Please stay away from crap, there's a lot of junk out there.
9/24/20, 4:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Even my technical analysis goes out for a toss on crazy companies
9/24/20, 4:18 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Agreed, this works on stocks with good fundamentals, which has a chance to go up post crashing....if it never comes up, than even god can’t help😁
9/24/20, 4:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Crappy
9/24/20, 4:19 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: 👍🏻
9/24/20, 4:30 PM - Niteen: 👍
9/24/20, 4:30 PM - Niteen: Yeah..learned it hard way, now paying off 🙂
9/25/20, 8:55 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thanks Nash. Can you plz post right when you add 🙂?
9/25/20, 8:56 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: So the trick is to keep some liquidity :). What % of your portfolio should be in cash?
9/25/20, 10:42 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The % of liquidity should be in line with where the overall market is. That liquidity % can decrease when market tanks and increase when market starts making all time highs. For eg, You may want to keep very low liquidity in March, and continue buying in support and increase when S&P went to all time highs
9/25/20, 10:44 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am a conservative investor so my liquidity may go range between  20%-50%
9/25/20, 10:44 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It will vary for folks
9/25/20, 10:46 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Since u already have half position, it would not entice me to buy until it gets to a strong support, which i understand is 410-420, above my purchase price of 380
9/25/20, 10:47 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: * Since I
9/25/20, 10:49 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The risk is it doesnt reach there, but I am always fine with missing out, rather than losing money.
9/25/20, 10:55 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Do you think zoom will tank significantly once vaccine comes on?
9/25/20, 11:12 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I don't know that. I will be invested until the story changes. 

Yesterday it was 10% down from their high and was in a range of $470 for a starter position
9/25/20, 11:13 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It went lower than that, so aggressive folks can keep a $465 limit
9/25/20, 11:14 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: However, its extended and if market tanks, it can come to my numbers above
9/25/20, 11:14 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Of $410-$420
9/25/20, 11:17 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: https://blog.zoom.us/high-fidelity-music-mode-professional-audio-on-zoom/
9/25/20, 11:20 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Rolling out another feature to capture another market. Zoom has become a verb like Google and I absolutely love the progress they are making.
9/25/20, 11:35 AM - Niteen: I taught a professional course university summer semester in New York this summer fully online using Zoom. I and my student absolutely loved the Zoom experience. Features like poll, quizzes and breakout rooms add a lot of value and makes it a great product. 👍 there is no parallel product in the market at the moment.
9/25/20, 12:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Great Feedback Niteen. I understand their virtual classroom is doing well, as they now command roughly ~40% market share of k-12 online classes 👍
9/25/20, 1:46 PM - Niteen: Yeah, my kids (grade 1 and 4) are already using zoom for their virtual classrooms 😃 so, Zoom is definitely in very commanding position 👍
9/25/20, 2:28 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: I wonder how Skype got left out even after having video call app since so many years
9/25/20, 2:30 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: because it sucks... most of the people r moving to zoom or slack or teams
9/25/20, 2:37 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: Skype is decommissioning and Teams is new thing
9/25/20, 3:04 PM - Niteen: Skype is dead like Nokia..one of those Microsoft acquisitions
9/25/20, 3:06 PM - Niteen: Microsoft started focusing on Teams when their plan to acquire Slack didn't go through. Teams and Zoom are two different products..not an apple to apple comparison.
9/25/20, 4:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Btw zoom is reportedly working on advanced messaging similar to slack. They want to significantly enhance their total addressable market by creating a complete communication ecosystem....likely coming next year
9/25/20, 4:52 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: 👍🏻 good info Nash. I think a pullback will b a good opportunity if we see one soon 😊
9/25/20, 4:58 PM - Niteen: 👍That will be a game changer. Zoom's adoption rate is already high in corporate, academia..public and private both..
9/25/20, 10:06 PM - +1 (201) 755-0082: Not a stock news but interesting take by Apple on masks!

9/27/20, 6:16 PM - +1 (972) 754-6465: Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and another $750 the following year, the newspaper reported, and none at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. He is personally responsible for more than $420 million in debt, most of which is coming due within the next four years, according to the Times. 🤔😃
9/27/20, 6:32 PM - +1 (952) 855-3587: Not sure whether he go stimulus check or not🤣🤣
9/27/20, 7:52 PM - Lalmani BJANA: This is quite possible. This is not illegal. All of us can reduce the tax to few penny. If anyone is interested, ping me personally.

9/28/20, 8:21 AM - +1 (201) 850-0875: He must be charging in millions  if not more. 😃
9/28/20, 10:24 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: He was a real estate developer and investor and is likely booking accounting losses from claiming depreciation to offset taxes. Also he had made a lot of poor investments (hotels, casinos, golf courses) when he was doing business, that lost money and eligible for lowering taxes.
9/28/20, 10:39 AM - +1 (757) 285-8122: Is this possible for employeed or business owners ?
9/28/20, 10:40 AM - Lalmani BJANA: Both

Not sure if it is still worth it or should wait for it's fall....  any expert opinion 🤔🤔
10/1/20, 6:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I own it. It's going in an area, which has historical seen overhead resistance between 280-290.  But its coming there for the 3rd time, who knows if 3rd time is the charm and it will break higher to blue skies ahead.

10/1/20, 8:20 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Hello All

Have a couple of questions for experts in this group and my question is based on this youtube Video (https://youtu.be/_k1A7YXdCpU)


Scenario: - Brokerage Account Balance - 10000

Transaction Details - 

Transaction Date - 10/01/2020

Transaction Type - Put Credit Spread

Expiry Date - 10/02/2020

SPY  - (Put Credit Spread,    Selling Put & Buying Put) 

SPY Price - 337 

SPY Selling Put - $334   —  Premium - 1.45
SPY Buying Put - $333.  — Premium -1.20

$1 Spread

Contract Size =1 


Amount Credited Temporarily-$25
Collateral Collected - $100



My Questions:

1. Why Think and Swim asks for 33k Collateral to execute  this but Robinhood just asks for $100 ?


2. Per the below Scenario of what will outcome at the end of 10/02/2020 4 PM

	2.a. If SPY ends the day at 335, then I should be able to keep the premium of $25 and will get my collateral of $100 Back. Is that correct?
	2.b. If SPY ends on below 334, then do I need to ‘BUY TO CLOSE’ the Sell Put by paying $33k and ‘Buy to Close” the BUY Put option by paying another $33k? I mean do I need to have $66k in my account when this spread transaction has to be exercised?
10/1/20, 8:22 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: thanks in Advance
10/1/20, 8:36 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not sure why Think and Swim needs the entire contract value when your maximum loss cannot be more than $75. On 10/2, it should close automatically and settle. 333.75 is your break even price. You will lose/gain below/above that number. I dont use these two brokerage, so folks doing day in day out should able to answer.
10/1/20, 8:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: @13366155435
10/1/20, 8:44 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: I think my max loss will be 525, not 75. isn’t it? 

(334*100)-(33*100)=400+125 (buy put premium)


Are you saying broker should automatically take care of this without me having 33k in the account?
10/1/20, 8:47 PM - +1 (716) 352-5996: I think max loss is 75
Width of strike * 100 - premium you got
10/1/20, 8:48 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Oh ok .. got it
10/1/20, 8:49 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Thank you Nash and Dino
10/1/20, 8:50 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Do I still need to keep 33k if price reaches strike price ?
10/1/20, 9:00 PM - +1 (716) 352-5996: I haven’t experienced this. I use tws and generally they keep collateral which is 100 in this case.
10/1/20, 9:09 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Yes thinkor swim keeps the collateral but robinhood allows to do the transaction with a collateral as width * 100 .. 

What i’m not sure is that how will this work when stick price reaches strike price. Will it cancels out based on buy put or I need the entire amount (33k) to buy yo close

10/2/20, 1:34 PM - +1 (480) 252-1728: Solar initial set up costs a lot, not sure if people can afford to that along with car cost
10/2/20, 1:42 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: In India also government is encouraging electric. That’s why Toyota has stopped investment in legacy cars in India. For a country like India it’s makes most sense to give incentives to electric car makers as India can aave billions on oil import.
10/2/20, 2:04 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: One of my friend did it for about 75k in Hyderabad. So don’t think it’s that bad.
10/2/20, 2:06 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Even in my home town, all the govt offices are going with solar.
It will definitely help to save the electricity for other purpose use.
10/2/20, 2:31 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Agree, solar panels and heaters both have significantly come down in terms of cost. We had solar heater that my dad installed in 1994, it is still pumping hot water. Maintenance is 500 rupees per year, 300 litres of hot water per day.
10/2/20, 2:31 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Ahmedabad gets too hot, having panels on terrace makes big difference.

10/7/20, 2:15 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: I have a small position in SEDG.

This company seems well positioned for growth due to increased interest in renewable energy space. They have a unique product offering in form of DC optimized inverters used in solar and pv kits.

They have good market in US and strong international potential. 

For past 3 years they logged 42.3% increase in revenue and has little debt. Cash flow is good.

I am planning to add more on dips.
10/7/20, 2:18 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: It was also one of the fool recommendations few weeks back.
10/7/20, 5:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I got in this when it was around $100 and have a full position. I agree that it has all the bells and whistles to be a dominant player in the clean/smart energy space serving storage, optimization, EV charging, batteries, grid services market. It would also have further tailwinds on a biden victory, who have made aggressive plans to ramp up renewable energy production. 

The company has operating leverage with cash flows and earnings growing faster than topline growth. Despite great fundamentals, the stock is so extended that its risky to buy at this time though.
10/7/20, 5:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍
10/7/20, 5:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍
10/7/20, 5:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Tik tok news was priced in afterall, I hope folks got in at $75. The stock had given this opportunity a couple of times.
10/7/20, 5:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 😒
10/7/20, 5:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Back to $140 from $105. I hope you had continue holding this and have bought on this dip
10/7/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: 👍🏻 The Biden factor is pretty unique and can move stock either ways depending on the result.
10/7/20, 5:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: May be a short term sell-off across the market, but that adds in earnings growth for this company relative to others in years to come. Bottomline is that it may be a buying opportunity for folks who don't have a position when everything will be crashing under the sun.
10/7/20, 6:39 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Aditya.
10/7/20, 6:40 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash, will put it in my watchlist
10/7/20, 6:43 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: What’s your opinion about Wayfair? Will it continue the ride if the Covid situation gets better?
10/7/20, 6:47 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Can it*
10/7/20, 7:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its a good stock and will do well over the long term, however I dont like the margins on this online furniture company. Put differently, etsy is cash flow positive with a $1bn in revenue, whereas W has just become positive now with $11bn in revenue. This also means that ROIC and ROE will likely be lower than other e-commerce player in the long run. 

The estimate long term growth forecast at 15% (seems conservative) is also much lower than Etsy's 50%. Dont think its a bad stock and will generate above market returns but Etsy is likely to do much better over the long run.

10/8/20, 12:28 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 👍🏻
10/8/20, 2:50 PM - +1 (551) 580-3181: excess CO2 is okay, anything over is inbalance in eco system that's dangerous too.. Trees are to observe CO2  and release Oxygen .. if the entire CO2 is converted as O2 then what happens to trees 🤔.. balancing is needed.
10/8/20, 5:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The amount of Co2 naturally consumed by 🌳 is significantly lower than the amount of gas emitted worlwide in the environment (China alone produces more gas than the world can absorb), which offcourse can be an existential crisis, if continued for long. 

Most countries wants to reach carbon neutral state by 2050, but a lot of things have to go right on a best effort basis to reach that state, not to mention political will. Any technology that can help expedite that goal will help the cause.
10/8/20, 5:23 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: Hope it is not another NIKOLA ...  If it is real then it is really great ...
10/8/20, 7:28 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Have CTSH through ESOP? Stock was struggling for past many months and recently had some good movement. Wondering if I should sell some or should wait more as it might possibly rise more. What does the technical analysis say? Thoughts?
10/8/20, 7:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Stock has done nothing for the last 5 yrs. Its been dead money. Recently as you suggested its been rising, which is encouraging. I would keep an eye on mid 80's (say $83-$85) If it goes above that, I may continue riding. If it struggles to cross that number, I may sell it. 

Having said that, there are dozens of opportunities better than this stock.  The company has mediocre fundamentals and I personally would not marry this stock for the long term.
10/8/20, 8:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If its continue moving north, good, if not, good-bye
10/8/20, 8:03 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻Thank you
10/8/20, 8:06 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: All the Technology companies are going up in India. From biggest TCS to mid and smaller, all are going up. Nifty IT Index itself is life high
10/8/20, 8:07 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: This may drive up CTS too
10/8/20, 8:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep, even then the stock is relatively weak than anything else. Other words you would been better served being invested in TCS and Infy and get multiple of returns versus this.
10/8/20, 8:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Opportunity cost

10/9/20, 5:52 PM - Niteen: I don't think so..the system/platform doesn't seem to scale with volume. I noticed this message several times and that's pretty common complaint from RH users. But I don't think it's due to any kind of attack on system...or mesage itself is a part of attack? Dont know.

10/9/20, 7:47 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: Also I read sometime back that the accounts in these platforms are insured so I guess these people should be able to get it back
10/9/20, 7:58 PM - +1 (773) 364-0061: can i transfer my robinhood share to webull?
10/9/20, 7:59 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: I guess yes, or u can liquidate n buy back if sold in profit
10/9/20, 8:02 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: Yes you can transfer from robingood to webull and they I think make it free also and give 2 free stocks
10/9/20, 8:02 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: No
10/9/20, 8:02 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: How withdraw can done as first bank account has to be linked and account should be on same name as RH account.. also it take some time
10/9/20, 8:02 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: You can transfer
10/9/20, 8:03 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: Also if someone add bank account then u will get email and push notifications..
10/9/20, 8:03 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: Webull has much better interface and you can download all your trades in excel file at end of day
10/9/20, 8:03 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: It’s way much better

10/9/20, 8:07 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: webull also runs lots of promotions. Sometime back they gave 25 free stocks for depositing 25k
10/9/20, 8:09 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: Also in robinhood I can trade only till 6 pm est whereas in webull you can trade till 8 pm est. although some features like fraction shares may not be there so do your comparison before you make a decision.
10/9/20, 8:20 PM - +1 (732) 331-3713: 👌

10/9/20, 9:31 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: Worst
10/9/20, 9:40 PM - Niteen: I would recommend Ameritrade instead..I have RH as well.
10/9/20, 9:41 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Are you talking about chase?
10/9/20, 9:42 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Ameritade is great ..think or swim is great
10/9/20, 9:42 PM - Niteen: Yes 👍, and they could improve their mobile app

10/9/20, 9:48 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: I have same issue with Xoom(PayPal) , sent few thousand dollars to India and it’s gone. Xoom deducted money from US bank, no money in Indian bank. Customer care says Transaction complete and no money will be refunded. Many cases on twitter about same issue.
10/9/20, 9:49 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: Got this in another group and many other messages from many people in that group. Be careful while using xoom for money transfer to India
10/9/20, 9:50 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: You can open webull account and use it for few days if u few happy then you can move ur RH to webull.
10/9/20, 9:50 PM - +1 (224) 829-8518: But is Robinhood or Webukl account insured?

10/14/20, 12:25 PM - +1 (609) 216-4502: It got a rating upgrade yday where target price became 40$, causing the current  run. i feel it has become a bit like Tesla where some investors are calling it a success before the results are in. But I think it can touch 40 with its small mkt cap base easily
10/14/20, 12:31 PM - +1 (224) 422-2950: Thanks

10/14/20, 10:38 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: I think we can wait patiently for 60
10/14/20, 10:38 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: 😀
10/14/20, 10:42 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: What special about $60
10/14/20, 10:48 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: No holding but I see strong supports around 86
10/14/20, 11:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I agree. Let me throw 3 levels without knowing how this will perform tomorrow and in relation to the market (best case to worst case)

1. $86-$90 - For people who don't have a position

2. $73-$76 - For people who have position. I dont think it will fall below this. Please note, the last time fastly bottomed exactly bottomed around $75, that I have called here. 

Around $50 - I don't think it will reach here, but one should always have a plan. One can be extremely greedy here.
10/14/20, 11:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: This was posted on Aug 7th message. Fastly closed around $74.96 on Aug 11th. Hope this provides context to my numbers above.
10/14/20, 11:33 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The irony here is the $71 million guidance (low end of the range) still  translates into a 42% growth over last year, despite TikTok, despite Covid.
10/14/20, 11:38 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: Thanks Nash, is good info

10/14/20, 11:53 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Yes.73-76 is strong support
10/14/20, 11:57 PM - +1 (408) 718-6359: 72 is strong support .. if it reach there 100% buy

10/15/20, 4:31 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Just like bank accounts you can open unlimited brokerage account as long as you’re not broke 😆
No, I mean seriously - zero balance accounts are harder to open

10/15/20, 5:57 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: But do note that SIPC is < FDIC $ insurance
10/15/20, 5:58 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: Please simplify...🤔
10/15/20, 6:00 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: FDIC insures dollar per dollar refund on loss if financial institution (simple boley to, Bank) dies.
SIPC “covers” and not “insures” up to 500k securities and 250k cash
10/15/20, 6:01 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: So SPIC is a protection and won’t cover if stocks decline or cover _worthless_ sells
10/15/20, 6:02 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: In short, if your cash or your stocks is less than 250k, just relax

10/15/20, 8:10 PM - Niteen: The worst thing about RH is there is no customer support number..you just can't talk to anyone if you need any help or facing any issues. They need to fix it or will customers eventually.
10/15/20, 8:11 PM - Niteen: They will lose* customers..

10/15/20, 8:14 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: You cd just transfer your account / positions no need to sell .. of course once sorted out of this
10/15/20, 8:15 PM - +1 (773) 364-0061: can u explain plz
10/15/20, 8:35 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: It is really beyond understanding that why should anybody go with RH when all major brokerages are also allowing commission free trading.

TDA, Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Etrade all are much better.
10/15/20, 8:35 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Sorry I wasn’t too detailed.
The Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS) allows the automated transfer of stock. It is some software based reliable system to Xfer stocks accurately.
Your new broker will initiate the transfer by communicating with the current broker. It usually takes 3-6 days
10/15/20, 8:37 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I can’t agree enough. Exactly.
In the past may be RH was lucrative with fractional trades and for cheap! But this is why I personally never was with RH, cuz I don’t think commission matters at all and then it became free
10/15/20, 8:37 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: That is, I don’t care if I pay say 10$ to buy some stocks of say Disney and sell it 15 years later if at all :)
10/15/20, 8:38 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Or even if I was a day trader for that matter

10/16/20, 10:00 AM - +1 (609) 216-4502: imho.The reason S&P valuation is all time high (pe 22) is due to low yield curve. this is similar to real estate prices going higher when fed rate is around 0 and mortgage rate is all time low. mrkt is always right :)

10/16/20, 1:17 PM - +1 (508) 502-8459: 03:31 AM EDT, 10/16/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Fastly (FSLY) on Thursday filed a registration statement covering the potential sale of up to about 6.4 million shares of the company's class A common stock to be offered by certain selling stockholders.
10/16/20, 1:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: That is related to signal science acquisition allowing their employees and existing shareholder to sell.
10/16/20, 1:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They have enough cash to carry on their operations. They might raise funds in the future, but this is nit a good time obviously given the decline. Given the timing, obviously they have no control on this
10/16/20, 1:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: *not
10/16/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (508) 502-8459: Ok
10/16/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The market doesn't care if its selling for raising cash or for distribution. More supply, lower prices
10/16/20, 1:28 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Anyways, I think this is good time to discuss psychology and how it impacts investor return

When Fastly was at $135 - This thing is going to $200. I may miss the boat. Buy, buy, buy

When Fastly is at $85 - This will crash more, I should wait. Hold or Sell. 

Going back to all time high is 50%+ return from here. While its difficult to talk about timing, there is no doubt that it will reach there and much above over the long term.
10/16/20, 1:29 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Which is why Prakash here provided a sensible approach for folks who don't have position
10/16/20, 1:35 PM - Niteen: I was too optimistic yesterday and got some..so, what do you recommend? Hold it for long term?
10/16/20, 1:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 💯
10/16/20, 1:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Always buy in phases 1/3
10/16/20, 1:36 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The lower it goes, the more capital you deploy
10/16/20, 1:37 PM - Niteen: Thanks Nash. That helps 👍..this was one off purchase for me 😃
10/16/20, 1:42 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not only for this stock, for  any high quality stock - 

1. Never buy during the highs. FOMO will not work most times, patience always does

2. Buy when no one likes it. 

3. Give it long enough time, so this fall will look like a blip 5 years from now.
10/16/20, 1:42 PM - Niteen: Super 👍👌

10/16/20, 2:20 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: 👌🏻👌🏻
10/16/20, 3:35 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Can’t agree more with this. I would like to share my two cents which I learnt in last 6 months of investing .... thoda gyan 😜.
I guess, to actually execute this strategy one needs to know their investments in an out and have to keep themselves updated with businesses. If someone just buys a ticker symbol they will not be able to follow this strategy( it’s very difficult to see a particular position going down 20-30% in a day and still buy it more)

If we put our money somewhere, we should be aligned with the vision of the business and believe in the company/ the CEO/ leadership etc and if we are, execution of Nash’s strategy will be a cakewalk. As a new investor I could take advantage of this strategy in stocks like Tesla( my largest investment), Square, Teladoc etc, fortunately I am up significantly.
10/16/20, 3:37 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: Thanks. Technically what are the support/resistance levels? What's a good entry point?
10/16/20, 3:59 PM - Niteen: 👍 thanks for sharing your experience.. and yes, I always keep my stop loss number handy, just in case 😆
10/16/20, 5:28 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep, one of the better ways to manage risk for investors is Position sizing - Always buy 1/3 or 1/4 of your full position when stock takes a hit. This will allow for you to be in control (not the market) and you would want the stock to go lower to accumulate more. 

Though I very much get that its painful for new investors.
10/16/20, 5:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Stop loss will work more  for traders not for investors, because the objectives are different. In trading, you want to minimize losses and keep stop loss for positions that goes against you. In investing, you want your favorite stock to go lower so that you can buy more of it and maximize returns over long period of time.
10/16/20, 5:35 PM - Niteen: Yeah..understand that part, sorry for confusion. What I wanted to say is that I usually come up with my own stop loss number beyond which I cant own the stock anymore..
10/16/20, 5:36 PM - Niteen: This is great 👍
10/16/20, 5:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Great question - There are number of ways to assess an entry point. I will tell you what different investors do - 

1. Calculate the annual volatility of the stock you wish to buy. You can go back in history and see the average, minimum and maximum drawdown for any investment. Assuming the average drawdown for Facebook is 10% and max is 30%. If I am a new investor, I will start accumulating FB only when it goes down 10%, and keep buying every 10% down to build a full position

2. You can rely on moving average 50, 100, 200. A simple trading tool will show you that 

3. You can keep track of important ratios like Price/Sale for growth company or Price/earnings for a stable company, and buy only when metrics improve. For eg, if your first buy is at 10 P/S, your second buy should only be lower than that. 

4. A) You can ignore market noise and add each month ratably (dollar cost averaging) or B) A better way is to only buy stocks on down months and ignore on up months to accumulate over time 

5. You can draw your own support resistance that I like to do, but you need to study TA for that.

There are pros and cons for each. You can see what suits your lifestyle and time you want to put in assessing companies.
10/16/20, 5:50 PM - Niteen: This is a great advice Nash 🙌🙌👍

Total online population is roughly 3-4 billion. So this is a large percentage of that already. the online population is inflated because many humans have multiple devices.l, so we should treat it as 2-3 bil.

There’s competing streaming services - 80 mil have Disney+, 115 mil have Prime.. and then there’s Hulu, YouTube tv and Sling... and Roku..

Market should cut Netflix some slack! It’s not going to be an exponential growth each and every quarter. 🙄

10/21/20, 9:43 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Quick question to the experts.. are there any disadvantages of trading penny stocks?
10/21/20, 9:47 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Reason for the ask- I got an email with a video from Raging Bull today .. saying they have a subscription model for penny stocks .. under $5.. with a potential to grow high... and guaranteeing $1000 to $10000 in 90 days .. 😆😀😀else the subscription will be free for the next 3 months.. subscription cost $799.
10/21/20, 9:48 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Want to understand what advantages / disadvantages do we have with trading penny stocks .. how come people are so confident in that kind of trading system
10/21/20, 9:48 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Any thoughts or comments ?
10/21/20, 10:04 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Use it for 30 days and if you don't see the benefits ,get the money back.
10/21/20, 10:04 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Not all their services are great
10/21/20, 10:06 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: thanks Sushant .. there's no money back policy.
10/21/20, 10:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If you make 10x in 3 mos starting at $1k, you will have a net worth of $10mm by end of year 1 and a billionaire (crossing warren) by end of year 2.

If its too good to be true, its probably isn't 

Search raging bull scam on social media sites and Google, and look at complaints at Better business bureau, you will know what to do.
10/21/20, 10:07 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Also I'm curious to know more about ad/disad about penny stock
10/21/20, 10:08 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Not necessarily you need to invest (Actual dollar) from their recommendations , you can use paper trading. Bulls Eye trade is one of the successful subscription or service i see from them is worth, that too when there is an offer ( like $7/month or $99 for Year)
10/21/20, 10:09 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: exactly right..How  can a system be so powerful.. and if they have it why sare they generous to share it with people
10/21/20, 10:09 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: that they will always recommend the OTC stocks which most of the recognized platform doesn't support.
10/21/20, 10:10 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: these days they have so many subscriptions..
10/21/20, 10:12 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Yea but why pay $799 to paper trade
10/21/20, 10:12 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: their money back is $2000 for lifetime
10/21/20, 10:12 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Only if Money back guarantee is offered
10/21/20, 10:12 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: money back within 3 0 days
10/21/20, 10:29 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: I think no matter what anyone offers, stay away from penny stocks ! They are penny stocks for a reason.
10/21/20, 10:32 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Ok.. but what are the possible implication ? Is it that the stick price can be easily manipulated?
10/21/20, 10:33 PM - Niteen: Give it a shot if you are convinced....then burn some or make some.. 😃
10/21/20, 10:37 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: haha .. If the subscription price would have been at $100 or $150 .. I would tried .. Not willing to bet my $799..

10/22/20, 10:49 AM - Niteen: Any reason why market is red today? Is it long wait on stimulus package or the election itself..
10/22/20, 10:50 AM - Niteen: Or both 😃
10/22/20, 11:14 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: stimulus package I believe.
10/22/20, 2:29 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Anyone know ER date of BYND? As per RH 11/2 but Fidelity showing 10/26

10/23/20, 11:39 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Hi All,

Elections are round the corner and it doesn’t seem a stimulus package would be released before elections. How much percentage of cash are you guys holding? Any one buying anything at these levels or everyone is just sitting tight and waiting for the market to go further down.
I just want to understand the high level approach not any stock specific, I have just 10% cash do you guys recommend to book some profit and increase my cash position or  you think 10% is sufficient.

@Nash- you did mentions few months back that you will share your election strategy, are you in a position to share your thoughts now or you want to wait for a week more. Your guidance is critical!
10/23/20, 11:49 AM - +1 (669) 235-0477: I was about to write the same, also is it logical to put more money now or just hold your position?
10/23/20, 11:49 AM - +1 (929) 215-4132: I am too in same situation.. and have similar thoughts going on .. should we book more profits and sit tight
10/23/20, 11:50 AM - +1 (929) 215-4132: But I think trump is coming back 😂
10/23/20, 11:52 AM - +1 (929) 215-4132: Experts plz help 🙂
10/23/20, 12:04 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I have looked at a study that I am sharing below on election results. Please note that I do not have any political bias and nor have a crystal ball. I am just sharing what history suggests, expecting that I can be wrong. 

Foe stock market, I need it to move in one direction or other to give any real guidance on levels. Currently its sitting nowhere, but hopefully it clears out in November.
10/23/20, 12:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
10/23/20, 12:10 PM - +1 (669) 235-0477: Thanks Nash! Its a good one.
10/23/20, 12:12 PM - Niteen: That's a nice piece of info..👍👌
IMO it would be wise to hold on to cash.. election is hardly 10 days away and then it will set the clear direction.
10/23/20, 12:14 PM - +1 (669) 235-0477: I have a question, even if anyone become a president, does market gets corrected after election or it plays a significant role based on the candidates?
10/23/20, 12:15 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash, this report doesn’t mention what happened when the incumbent president lost, did the market go further down.
What strategy should we go with, the market has already lost significantly, should we increase our cash position to benefit from the further dip post election dip.
10/23/20, 12:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The worst case scenario for the market is a contested election - 

When you have delay in finding a leader due to dispute of vote counts, combined with third wave of coronavirus and stimulus bill stuck in congress because of lack of leadership.
10/23/20, 12:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Typically, 1st year is lukewarm on arrival of a new president (sometime positive sometime negative) because he is trying to figure things out and make his way.  However, a blue sweep (democratic president and senate) will be helpful as tax cuts will be offset by economic stimulus.
10/23/20, 12:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: *tax increases
10/23/20, 12:23 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If trump comes in, he will continue his policy, but after coronavirus, China trade war will become forefront on market condition
10/23/20, 12:26 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The best outcome for next year is for market to sell off going in November and December and complete wave 2 downside to rise next year. I would love the market to visit near 3k level, for being overweight to equities.
10/23/20, 12:32 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash, we all know that you don’t have a crystal ball but your predictions are right most of the times, though you are refraining from giving the exact comment like “sell off now or hold or buy “😁, but I guess you are indicating a downward movement for the market in the near term. 
As Friday’s are sell off generally, I am going to hold on today and see how the early next week go and accordingly will increase my cash position to 25-30%.
Appreciate your inputs!
10/23/20, 12:39 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Just out of curiosity, what percentage of cash are you holding up, if you could share.
10/23/20, 12:42 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Sorry but I am unsure of the movement in the near term. My bias is lower first then higher, but the market has been in a strong bull market and its hard to kill a bull. 

Given everything, some amount of cash will not hurt, particularly when we have a risk event on the doors.
10/23/20, 12:48 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Do you mean the “lower first” has already happened like the ongoing dip or do you anticipate a downward movement for next few months as well before the market starts to go up again early- mid - late next year.
10/23/20, 12:52 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Not sure if my comprehension was right but I understood from above few posts that probability of downward movement is more than upward movement for next few months
10/23/20, 12:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Unsure, I discussed market to reach 3250 earlier in September. The market bottomed at 3230.  Since that time, we are stuck in the middle of high and low, it is not giving any direction on the next leg.  If we breach the low, the probability increase to reach near $3k level. I will be watching it very carefully to protect myself on the downside.
10/23/20, 12:55 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Are you booking or planning to book profits to increase your cash position before elections or not yet decided
10/23/20, 12:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am comfortably positioned now. I will increase if we move towards the high and reduce if we move towards the low.
10/23/20, 12:58 PM - Niteen: Nice back try 😅
10/23/20, 1:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: What i am saying is everyone should have some level of cash given the uncertain environment. The cash position should be based on where the market is today. If it moves higher to 3600, we should increase the cash level and it it moves towards the down side 3300-3000, we should reduce it.
10/23/20, 1:02 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I am a new person nvestor and am just trying to understand. 
Nash’s entry points are pretty low, he might not mind the market going down by 15-20% as he will be still significantly up on most of his positions, but for me it matters, hence was just trying to get his views 😁
10/23/20, 1:04 PM - Niteen: That's absolutely perfect 😆..I'm also learning..what I meant was it was nice try to get more information out from Nash..Obviously we all are benefiting a lot from Nash's opinion and recommendations and I really look forward to them..😃
10/23/20, 1:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I appreciate it, but sometimes there is just limited information for us to act on. We should just let market to dictate what its going to do next. 

On entry points, I am pretty sure if you invest in quality companies long term, you will have much lower entry points and election will be a non event looking back.
10/23/20, 1:08 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: May the markets be with all of you 👍
10/23/20, 1:09 PM - Niteen: Amen 🙏
10/23/20, 1:12 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Agreed Nash, in long term it would just look like a dip, just trying to avoid any blunder during this election which I might regret later, hence all these queries😁
10/23/20, 1:14 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: From market perspective, biden is better even though he comes with promise to increase taxes. Senate will hold down the taxes for sometime.
10/23/20, 1:14 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Biden is good, because he will print shamelessly.
10/23/20, 1:14 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: He will print till USD is wrecked
10/23/20, 1:15 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: All that money will inflate capital markets.
10/23/20, 1:15 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: If Trump returns, taxes won't change, but he will rein in the printing.
10/23/20, 1:16 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: He won't give shit about markets after his election.
10/23/20, 1:16 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: May be some more tax reforms and lower regulations, but largely it will remain lame duck presidency like usual 2nd terms.
10/23/20, 1:21 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: But market has a perception that trump will be good for the stock market as that is one of his core focus area as he has flaunted it multiple times in his term
10/23/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: If Biden wins, the buzz is like almost certain that market would go down, it would be interesting to see how the market performs in reality
10/23/20, 1:33 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: After election, I don't think he cares much
10/23/20, 4:21 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/07/23/historical-stock-market-returns-under-every-us-president/
10/23/20, 4:21 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: History tells us that Market does better under democrats, just that DT has been talking about so people think market has done better under him. Look at the history, it did much better under Clinton and Obama.
10/23/20, 4:22 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: so a JB win - is likely better for the markets
10/23/20, 5:29 PM - +1 (781) 774-0196: On that note, much of what Trump brags about was the result of a foundation set by Obama the previous yrs.
10/23/20, 5:31 PM - +1 (781) 774-0196: Like what others have already said, Trump isn’t gonna give a damn about the market if he wins again. Will just create chaos with his tweets whenever he feels the urge to make a few million shorting
10/23/20, 6:17 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Trump may be abnoxious, but he did reduce the tax. Biden is useless politician guy,, all he wants is to tax earners and give freebies to poor. Typical socialism. Some of his plans are more obnoxious than Trump.
10/23/20, 6:18 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I don't vote here. But I will vote for Trump, because he is better for India (given continuous aggression by china and Pakistan).
10/23/20, 6:19 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: True
10/23/20, 6:19 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Never voting Dems, because of support to anti CAA NRC movements and democratic congressmen joining Pakistan caucus. That is enough for me to keep voting republicans, no matter whoever is the candidate
10/23/20, 6:23 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Agree
10/23/20, 8:14 PM - +1 (732) 983-7189: 100% agree

10/24/20, 1:50 PM - +1 (518) 256-7108: 👌🏻
10/24/20, 4:17 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: By Friday, I had 20% cash. Planning to sell 5% more before election if get an opportunity to exit....My view is that no matter who wins, market will go up overall (may be with different mix). There might be a short time uncertainty hence volatility around election (both before and after).  If the results are too close and it comes down to counting postal ballet then uncertainty will linger more. But eventually will settle down. And you will find enough stocks/opportunities/valuation to invest. My thought.
10/24/20, 4:32 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Trump only cares about winning the election. And market is his main poll plank. He has to stick with it to fight this term as has nothing else to boast about. But once he wins (this being the last term) he may not care the market as much and will have some other agenda.
10/24/20, 4:32 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Next 4 years he will play golf
10/24/20, 4:33 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Obama did same thing. Second terms are usually lame ducks
10/24/20, 4:33 PM - +1 (732) 986-0073: He has no agenda, he will just enjoy life 😄
10/24/20, 4:36 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: In fact that’s what will take market up more under Joe as compared to Trump. Stimulus package + all reform spending planned by Joe will help market.
10/24/20, 4:38 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Agree. Government spending will be out of the roof
10/24/20, 4:39 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I won't say his policies are progressive reforms though
10/24/20, 4:41 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: India will be fine either way. Democrats may play more balance approach but can’t ignore/antagonize India. That’s not a choice anymore. On the contrary Trump just speaks.  Do not see India getting anything special because of Trump which otherwise might not have happened.
10/24/20, 4:47 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: :):). I am a neutral voter. I like Republican for theirs nationalism but unable to make up my mind for another 4 years of Trump. China has become more powerful under Trump regime. Bernie Sander had a Pakistani campaign manager who had him include JnK and other anti Indian items in his poll plank. I don’t think any new government will play against India.

10/24/20, 4:50 PM - +1 (781) 774-0196: Here’s Biden’s agenda for working with India and the Indian American community in the U.S.
10/24/20, 4:51 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Yaa. With his best friend Putin and likely in North Korea :).

10/24/20, 6:17 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: He is a good businessman and is running USA like a business. Missing diplomacy terribly.

10/24/20, 8:06 PM - Niteen: The most important post in between 😃
10/24/20, 8:15 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: That’s result of being a democracy. You can have anyone rule the country by manipulating media. I am sure tomorrow there will be a campaign in America to give lgbt community a chance like today they want a female president. I am not against any of that but how is it justified that you support or not support someone based on these biological identifiers instead of capabilities. Some people voting for trump just because he is white or male is same as some people voting for Obama because he is black. Moreover undecided voters in America are very less. Most already support a party and stick with it no matter how bad is their candidate!!

10/28/20, 10:47 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Dropped 150 points to my earlier indicative level of 3300. If it closes and above, it will try to stage a rally, if not you know the downside
10/28/20, 10:47 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: *closes and stays
10/28/20, 10:50 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: SWA US.vcf (file attached)
10/28/20, 10:50 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Admin - please add this contact to the group
10/28/20, 11:31 AM - +1 (727) 248-1546: If it didnot closes above 33000 today. Need to sell all stocks and cash it untill situation gets better?
10/28/20, 11:35 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Nope, it will not be wise to sell all stocks, but longer it closes and stay (for a couple of days) below 3300, the higher the probability that its going down to around the 3050-3100 level. I need to do work on my downside number, but this will be a great level to start deploying cash. I will also come with a worst case scenario if we continue to go down.
10/28/20, 11:36 AM - +1 (727) 248-1546: Thanks Nash
10/28/20, 11:38 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: After this sell-off whenever its over, we should be  seeing 4000 in s&p handle over the next couple of years, so its a great time to prepare your shopping list 👍
10/28/20, 11:41 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash.... we all will be waiting for your analysis😁
10/28/20, 11:42 AM - +1 (201) 850-0875: True. Waiting.

10/28/20, 1:58 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Ya we should plan so that we don’t lose any low hanging fruits at least.
This time if market gives an opportunity will enter Amazon, FB, Shop, Se, TTD, Zoom. 
Would request everyone to share their watchlists for the crash please.
Also, if we can start a discussion around buying level, would be beneficial for all of us.

10/28/20, 2:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Someone discussed Fiverr earlier in this group. I did not comment because the price was high at $160. I had a limit order for 1/3rd filled today at $142. Its a marketplace for services providing freelancing services on 300+ jobs on their website and take a cut like Amazon, airb&b and likes. Calling it Amazon of services will be a stretch, but they are executing it really well. I am bullish long term on the industry, which provides a lot of flexibility to both employees and employers. 

They just announced result  with growth accelerated 88%, Gross margin at 84%, active buyer up 37% and spend per buyer increasing 20%. I like what i am seeing and will buy more on dips.
10/28/20, 2:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: This is a great list 👍
10/28/20, 2:24 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash, will add to my watch list.
10/28/20, 2:55 PM - Niteen: Thanks Nash. I'm tracking FVRR.. any prediction for FSLY?
10/28/20, 2:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Broken my levels given the tough market conditions, which is not good. I am not taking any additional position given we have earnings today. Long term, the thesis does not change.
10/28/20, 3:03 PM - Niteen: Is there any chance the earning will change the direction for the stock as it did for FVRR? Any thoughts?
10/28/20, 3:36 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The option market was pricing a $5 movement. If it does, it will be a good buy, if it does not, we will soon visit the downside. We have to give this stock time and space to do its thing, and eventually recover.
10/28/20, 4:26 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Teladoc & Fastly both down post results

10/28/20, 4:28 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Teladoc is down almost 10%
10/28/20, 4:33 PM - Niteen: both will come up...
10/28/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Very pleased with results of all of our explosive growth stocks. It doesnt matter what stocks will do tomorrow, but what it will do over the next 5-10 to create serious wealth

Launched a buy now, pay later solution, which is increasing becoming a popular method to pay by young shoppers. Launched the Tiktok channel to allow merchants to market their products, will test new e-commerce features.
10/29/20, 8:22 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Novocure - 44% growth in rev to $132mm, 10% beat, Gross margin improved 4% to 79%, net income increased sub 400%, active patient up 22%, continue to make advancement of clinical trials for lung, pancreatic, brain and ovarian cancer which will improve its TAM over the next 5vyrs.
10/29/20, 10:52 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Fsly came to  60's zone. My guess, it will touch 200ma
10/29/20, 10:56 AM - +1 (408) 718-6359: 55 is 200 MA support
10/29/20, 10:59 AM - +1 (669) 235-0477: What is MA SUPPORT?
10/29/20, 11:02 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Worst case scenario is activated. My guess is anywhere between $50-65.
10/29/20, 11:03 AM - Niteen: Moving Average
10/29/20, 11:04 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Citi has pt 48
10/29/20, 11:05 AM - Niteen: I'll revisit this once I see some upward momentum
10/29/20, 11:06 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah in the neighborhood
10/29/20, 11:06 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Of worst price
10/29/20, 11:08 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yes, we will have to let it do its thing, stabilize and buy when it starts recovery. Since it broke a major support, doesn't seem a good idea to catch a falling knife
10/29/20, 11:09 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: I agree with price zone. The thing that concern me is the insiders selling. Huge selling from insiders
10/29/20, 11:10 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Most of it is 10b5-1
10/29/20, 11:10 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: I agree wit your price zone*
10/29/20, 11:12 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: What it means is that they have set a pre-planned sale date in compliance with insider laws. Irrespective of the price, they will sell on predetermined dats
10/29/20, 11:12 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Dates
10/29/20, 11:12 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Ok
10/29/20, 11:22 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Still hold 11% if all shares. 

Arthur Bergman is the chief architecture officer and one of the best is the world of how the architect of internet works

Signal science acquisition is accretive (security offering) and is growing faster than CDN

Their customers are the who's and who's of the world - Twitter, shopify, etsy, airb&b, stripe and is based on usage. More usage on the platform, more revenue, however as I had suggested earlier its more volatile than cloudfare (which is why I own more of cloudfare) 

Edgecompute has started and they have raving reviews from customers

New partnership with Google cloud, only cdn which is offered in their marketplace. 

All of these benefits are yet to come.
10/29/20, 11:37 AM - Niteen: What's your take on AMWL?
10/29/20, 11:39 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I own livango which will be acquired by Teladoc, and leader in telehealth, so did not look at amwell

10/29/20, 2:01 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: well when it increased 10% then I thought it is done for the day but now it is 14%+ . So don't know where it will stop but from option perspective I think you can wrap up.

10/29/20, 2:49 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Yea if the subscription cost is less say $50 -$100 then it might be reasonably OK to subscribe OR if you are sharing the subscription with a few friends and the subscription cost comes down .. then it might be nice k..
10/29/20, 2:49 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: But many times twitter has good source for some information
10/29/20, 2:50 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Else paying for a subscription $799 to much
10/29/20, 2:54 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: How? Do we have alerts in twitter?
10/29/20, 2:57 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I think you can update alert on their website in your account.

10/29/20, 7:14 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Black Friday

10/29/20, 11:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: In the same way, 90% of the time, there is no news for any company or stock, but it keeps doing its thing. The only thing that explains that is sentiment. Sentiment is what drives stock prices in the short run. Its not news, but how the market perceives the news. Eventually, it will move in line in earning in medium to long term.
10/30/20, 10:22 AM - Niteen: TDOC at 202? Nice price to get in..any thoughts?
10/30/20, 10:37 AM - +1 (669) 235-0477: Market is so lucrative right now. Getting confused to put in more money or not? Any suggestions?

10/30/20, 11:52 AM - +91 98117 73057: BlackFriday pre-sales going on.😜😜
10/30/20, 11:54 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its true that its a 90% down day, and we may see a rally, however given the uncertainty around elections, we may not be out of the woods. Its ok to buy some, but keep a bigger picture that there is a possibility for more pain ahead.
10/30/20, 11:54 AM - Niteen: TDOC 196 now..

10/30/20, 11:57 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep, one needs to have enough fire power if market become ridiculously cheap
10/30/20, 11:57 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Any thoughts on averaging BA?
10/30/20, 11:57 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Or stay away and look for lot other better opportunities?

10/30/20, 2:33 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Will Amazon go down because of election? Or is the price right now good to get in on to start a position?

10/30/20, 2:44 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Will Amazon go down because of election? Or is the price right now good to get in on to start a position?
10/30/20, 2:52 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: No one can predict the bottom hence it’s good to buy on dips, the approach I am taking is to increase my position with every 5% drop for Amazon. Like my first order got executed at 3050, the next order I have placed for 2900

If you would have noticed Amazon crashed just 20% in March, so I am hoping this time as well it will not crash for more than 20% before it bounces back, hence this approach, rest I might go wrong as well with my strategy but will stick to it for now.
10/30/20, 3:14 PM - Niteen: IMO It's going to be little chaotic for next few days or for at least for next week and then market will slowly adjust to it. But all growth stocks such as AMZN, MSFT etc. with good fundamentals, strong track records and outstanding recent performances will bounce back for sure..
10/30/20, 4:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The low today was around 10 points off from my levels above 🙏

Negative - we closed today and the week below 3300. I have been talking about the importance of this number. No other way to look at this other than its negative. 

Did we bottom yet - It didn't hit my number and it didn't close above 3300, so I will go with No. The risk is  that it was close. My bias is may be dead cat bounce next week and then at-least visit my levels
10/31/20, 12:26 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Does anyone here use the subscription of thetradewar.com ?

11/2/20, 1:45 PM - Niteen: It's a very different race this time due to Covid and mail in ballots situation..hope everyone is following the news 😃no one is sure if we will have a clear winner tomorrow.
11/2/20, 1:47 PM - +1 (201) 456-7921: One question though will the mail ballots posted by tomorrow EOD would be counted even if it reaches 2-3 days late?
And if it does then how one can declare a clear winner?
11/2/20, 1:47 PM - +1 (732) 688-0430: Markets can handle good news. 
market's van handle bad news.
Markets can not handle UNCERTAINTY
11/2/20, 1:48 PM - +1 (669) 235-0477: Thats the issue. They allowed to accept mail in ballots i guess till 10th of nov. and heard that its a different dates for each states.
11/2/20, 1:50 PM - Niteen: Dont forget electoral votes.. if one candidate crosses 270 mark then he is a winner..and ppl can keep counting votes behind the scene.
11/2/20, 1:53 PM - Niteen: What I'm hearing from news (both left and right media) that will come down to Pennsylvania or Arizona in worst case scenario..in that situation you will not have a clear winner and the country has to wait until all votes are tabulated.
11/2/20, 1:56 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: <Media omitted>

11/2/20, 2:11 PM - Niteen: Haha..you never know..😜😂
11/2/20, 2:14 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: I am absolutely unsure this time. A lot of factors are in play - Covid is one of the major ones.🤔
11/2/20, 2:31 PM - Niteen: I saw ZNGA recommendation in Motley Fool..the market assumption is that gaming will go up during pandemic.. but I dont have any position yet.
11/2/20, 2:33 PM - Niteen: would love to hear more about ZNGA from experts here.
11/2/20, 2:59 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: I had a small position of ZNGA which I bought last year for around 4 ish
11/2/20, 3:00 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: It almost doubled and I think it still have scope to grow further
11/2/20, 3:28 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: My all time profitable share of Livongo got converted to Tdoc... with literally no profit and some change 🤔☹️🙁🙁
11/2/20, 3:29 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: So, my doubt is,  we don't get any call before converting our shares,, 

I mean i could have encased it and would put into different stock..

🤔🤔🤔

11/3/20, 9:52 AM - +1 (646) 744-7953: Best stock to buy today
11/3/20, 9:53 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I would suggest to wait for election result before opening any new position.
11/3/20, 9:53 AM - +1 (646) 744-7953: Ok Anand ji thank you
11/3/20, 10:04 AM - Niteen: 👍
11/3/20, 10:28 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Everything is 4-5% up, is it a dead cat bounce or are we out of the woods
11/3/20, 11:01 AM - Niteen: Big Tech rise indicates blue..let's wait and watch
11/3/20, 11:10 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Doesn't look like a dead cat bounce, but not necessarily out of the woods. My expectation is still a lower low, but as I had highlighted that the S&P reached very close to my number, and its possible that I may be wrong. The only way to know is to wait and see the results and let the market do its thing.
11/3/20, 11:10 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Looks like florida has firmly tilted towards Trump

11/3/20, 12:09 PM - +1 (408) 718-6359: Does anyone has issue with Thinkrswin or tdameritrade while placing orders?
11/3/20, 12:09 PM - +1 (408) 718-6359: ThinkRSwim*
11/3/20, 12:09 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yaa let’s wait and see how it goes
11/3/20, 12:10 PM - +1 (972) 754-6465: Today I got error you are not allowed to open new equity positions.
11/3/20, 3:58 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Is BABA going to go further down
11/3/20, 4:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Use the low of today as a guide around $280, if it breaks, its probably going lower
11/3/20, 4:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Long term, no worries, its a monster. Short term its get tricky because you are  doing options
11/3/20, 4:36 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: I do have long term options, but bought few short term options which is in deep red today
11/3/20, 4:37 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: But didn’t expect to go that down
11/3/20, 4:56 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: there was an over reaction on BABA news today. The issue does not impact BABA as much as the price action today. Once the issue is settled b/w regulators and ant, today's news should be a non-issue.

11/4/20, 9:07 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Lvgo and tdoc data unavailable on TD. When is the merger suppose to complete
11/4/20, 9:08 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Market is playing game 😀
11/4/20, 9:09 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Market is underestimating what Trump does if he loses...may be not
11/4/20, 9:24 AM - Niteen: What's your take Nash..the market behavior is funny..is that what you expected 😃
11/4/20, 10:34 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: <Media omitted>
11/4/20, 10:34 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Looks like clear voter fraud by state democrats
11/4/20, 10:35 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Literally 100% of votes in night went to Biden
11/4/20, 10:41 AM - +1 (630) 525-1438: Could you please elaborate?
11/4/20, 10:41 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/11/04/californians-vote-to-allow-uber-and-lyft-to-classify-workers-as-independent-contractors.html
11/4/20, 10:42 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Could be mail in ballots, which is expected to have democrat vote Bank
11/4/20, 10:43 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, but not 100%-0% split. That is statistical impossibility
11/4/20, 10:44 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Also in texas, the counties where the educated folks live( austin/dallas/st antonio/) are all  are blue and the rest of the state is red
11/4/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I think more sensible people vote for Trump than biden.
11/4/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 😂
11/4/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: No comments
11/4/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (857) 225-0175: Lol good.. it can get messy pretty quick
11/4/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: This was my expectation. S&P reached 3230 and Futures reach 3225 before turning, roughly 5-10 points off from what I had said. 

My expectation is still reaching my level or a lower low, but I want to make this clear that no one should follow me blindly. We all know that It is extremely complicated to call markets over the short run.  Because of human psychology, a large majority of investors underperform (both institutions and retail), and a large majority of investors will underperform the market going forward. 

The only edge that individual investor will have is to focus on high quality stocks, buy in batches when they have gone down and focus on long run.
11/4/20, 10:46 AM - +1 (502) 296-0435: 👍🏻
11/4/20, 10:46 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Typically uneducated and racist people vote for Trump.
11/4/20, 10:47 AM - +1 (917) 375-5298: Agree
11/4/20, 10:48 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Disagree. Don't think 48-49% people in USA are ignorant racists.
11/4/20, 10:48 AM - +1 (917) 375-5298: it is truth accept it ...
11/4/20, 10:48 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, Trump does get vote from white proud boys and working classes
11/4/20, 10:49 AM - +1 (781) 774-0196: Agree
11/4/20, 10:49 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: guys guys...no political discussion here
11/4/20, 10:49 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: But check miami dade county, he got cuban Hispanics. In pennsylvania, he got Amish.

11/4/20, 10:49 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Lets wait
11/4/20, 10:49 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 👍🏻 it can get pretty messy quickly, here too 😂
11/4/20, 10:49 AM - +1 (917) 375-5298: 👍👍😁😁
11/4/20, 10:50 AM - +1 (781) 774-0196: Pls don't just make vague statements of voter fraud or anything else
11/4/20, 10:51 AM - +1 (404) 394-1763: 👍🏽
11/4/20, 10:51 AM - +1 (917) 375-5298: And no political discussion also this is market related group only
11/4/20, 10:51 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: 👍🏻

11/4/20, 10:52 AM - +1 (781) 774-0196: 👍

11/4/20, 10:53 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍
11/4/20, 10:54 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Completely agree and the last paragraph provides the guidance on next steps.
Patience is virtue here, looking at current dynamics we might see few ups and downs before market stabilises so shouldn’t hurry and wait for right buying opportunities in our favourite stocks.
11/4/20, 10:54 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍
11/4/20, 10:56 AM - Niteen: Agree 👍
11/4/20, 10:56 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Market is going up like anything
11/4/20, 10:57 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: S&P 500 $90+ up
11/4/20, 10:57 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I didn't expect like this
11/4/20, 10:57 AM - Niteen: Yeah..this is crazy..
11/4/20, 10:58 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: and I bought SPY put yesterday 🤦🏻‍♂️
11/4/20, 11:00 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It seems Powell is back in action and market has factored a trump win, but it reverses and Biden wins god knows where the market would go, should be prepare for both the scenarios
11/4/20, 11:02 AM - Niteen: I was listening to Fox..some betting market news that they were covering and 75% market bet on Biden
11/4/20, 11:04 AM - Niteen: So, basically if Biden keeps NV and flips WI and MI..game over.
11/4/20, 11:04 AM - +1 (732) 986-0073: All sensible people actually, ppl who do not have agenda and want to see USA progress vote for Trump
11/4/20, 11:05 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I think PA will be critical too
11/4/20, 11:06 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: So the current market rallying on a Biden win? Interesting
11/4/20, 11:07 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: guys...pls do not start again
11/4/20, 11:07 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: surprising me also. lets see.
11/4/20, 11:09 AM - Niteen: PA is critical but based upon current tally if Biden gets NV, WI, MI he is 270+..Trump can keep PA and still lose.
11/4/20, 11:10 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: That ways ya..
11/4/20, 11:11 AM - Niteen: Yeah..betting market is going that route..but once we have the winner, I'm sure market is going to react to it.
11/4/20, 11:12 AM - +1 (408) 306-8501: Please suggest few short term stocks to buy after results.
11/4/20, 11:15 AM - Niteen: Im tracking AMWL..but it is already 14+ % up today..just wait and watch. They have their earnings due on Nov 11..
11/4/20, 12:07 PM - Niteen: Everyone asking the same question..😜

11/4/20, 2:00 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: yes, given all Biden voters are educated and superior beings, I hope they respect group agenda.
11/4/20, 2:39 PM - +1 (201) 423-6408: Election results have impact on market, not who voted whom 😊

11/4/20, 3:22 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Zapata County, Texas is the second most Hispanic county in America.

In 2012, Obama won it by 43 points.

In 2016, Hillary won it by 33 points.

In 2020, Biden lost it by 5 points.

Hot Damn! 💋

11/4/20, 3:37 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Now that senate is firmly with republican, and presidency with Biden.
11/4/20, 3:37 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Are we getting stimulus?
11/4/20, 3:37 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Are we getting tax increases?
11/4/20, 3:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I just present facts, people are free to infer what they like to.
11/4/20, 4:31 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Market has been projecting a biden win for past two weeks and been positioning for it and as expected, it went up when Biden established lead.

11/5/20, 2:15 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: The analyst projections were for  around $38-40. Don't know if it will go any higher in the short term
11/5/20, 2:15 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: For NIO
11/5/20, 2:17 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: hmm
11/5/20, 2:17 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: SOLO is 17%+ up today...if this momentum continue then this is also good to invest else leave
11/5/20, 2:22 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Same is XPEV

11/5/20, 3:02 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: XPEV is Chinese. I think due to news of win of Biden it is moving up. Infact almost all Chinese stocks if I am not wrong. 
Solo is from Canada. It's vehicles are good but price is high, not sure how long it will compete in the market but its segment is entirely different than Tesla and NIO.
11/5/20, 3:02 PM - Niteen: For some reason I liked this theory..seems to be working for most of us here 😃

11/5/20, 3:23 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I think lets wait for tomorrow. If momentum continue then get in but keep watching. I strongly feel that these all are increasing due to election result.
11/5/20, 3:32 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: right.  And against the popular opinion - this is exactly what I had said on October 23 at 4:21 PM.  " JB win is better for the market "
11/5/20, 3:36 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Spce report today

11/5/20, 3:53 PM - Niteen: Anyone tracking bitcoins.. BTC or ETH? They are rallying for a while now..
11/5/20, 3:54 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I am irresponsibly long in Bitcoin since $3400 last year.
11/5/20, 3:55 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I think we should see dip to $12.5k in near future, before all time high (>$20k)
11/5/20, 3:56 PM - Niteen: So BTC would go 5K+ more in your opinion..interesting
11/5/20, 3:57 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, with high level of certainity in next 6-8 months
11/5/20, 3:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
11/5/20, 3:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: On Nov 15, 2018, I made the above call when Bitcoin was $6000, Bitcoin bottomed at $3100 in December and rest is history
11/5/20, 3:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Though I agree it should go much above $20k
11/5/20, 3:59 PM - Niteen: So what's the recommendation or thoughts? Could you guys provide more insight?
11/5/20, 4:00 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, that was great time to buy. We got in around $3400. Then doubled down at $4800 during March crash.
11/5/20, 4:00 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: Is it the first time when N & N both agreed
11/5/20, 4:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ha ha
11/5/20, 4:01 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 👍🏻 😄
11/5/20, 4:01 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Bitcoin will change the world
11/5/20, 4:01 PM - Niteen: 😜Bitcoin seems to brought them together in agreement 🙌🙌
11/5/20, 4:01 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: You will see unexpected alignments 😎
11/5/20, 4:01 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: I will also invest now in Bitcoin
11/5/20, 4:02 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am ok to agree with what I see very favourablr risk adjusted return. When everyone was a bear at that time, no doubt it was time for a turn
11/5/20, 4:02 PM - Niteen: We need disagreements..if everyone is in agreement then something is not right 😃
11/5/20, 4:02 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: Becuase Tech and Fundamentalist both agreed on same thing 😅
11/5/20, 4:03 PM - Niteen: So what's the final word..Do you guys recommend to get some?
11/5/20, 4:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Interestingly this friend of mine did not buy hoping it will continue falling. When it started rising, he thinks its too expensive.
11/5/20, 4:07 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: Nash bhai .. what should be the range to enter in it?
11/5/20, 4:08 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Having strong belief and understanding gets you over. Need fundamentalist to catch such falling knifes
11/5/20, 4:09 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I think it should pull back before rocket. But rocket is certainity.
11/5/20, 4:09 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Usual pull backs are 10-20% range
11/5/20, 4:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
11/5/20, 4:22 PM - +1 (631) 429-6726: 😀
11/5/20, 4:23 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: thanks bhai
11/5/20, 4:23 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: RH is good to buy or some other platform?
11/5/20, 4:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I dont use RH, but yeah go ahead.
11/5/20, 4:25 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Not recommend using robinhood if you are investing for long term
11/5/20, 4:25 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: which one is good? does ameritrade has bitcoin?
11/5/20, 4:26 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: For long term, buy on coinbase,, then transfer it to hardware wallet
11/5/20, 4:27 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Hardware wallet-> trezor, ledger or multisignature wallet like casahodl
11/5/20, 4:27 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: This significantly reduces risk related to exchange hacking
11/5/20, 4:31 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: thanks
11/5/20, 4:45 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I use ledger nano hardware wallet for majority of the funds, though keep some in the exchange for trading
11/5/20, 4:58 PM - Niteen: 👍

11/5/20, 5:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Cloudfare's Results

- Reached 100k customer and $100MM in revenue for first time.
- Quarterly revenue up 54% beating Fastly's by 12% (10% beat)
- 76% margin, 2% lower than last quarter
- 47% growth for fiscal 2020 (guidance)

10% up after market and 70%+ from the time we discussed earlier this year.
11/5/20, 5:45 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: 👍
11/5/20, 5:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Roku's result

- Revenue up 73% to 450MM (beat by 20%)
- GM rose 200bps to 48%
- Added 2.9MM active account to 46MM. Average revenue /user up 20%
- Q4 revenue guidance in mid 40% (seems conservative given the momentum, holiday season and beat)

Shares up only 2% after market (may be because of guidance) but up 185% from the first time we discussed.
11/5/20, 6:12 PM - Niteen: 👌what should be good entry point?
11/5/20, 6:13 PM - +1 (727) 248-1546: Also TTD had a good result. Could you pls add the analysis for that too?
11/5/20, 6:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It went to a low of $50 last week, tomorrow it will be $65. Keep an eye and buy on the next pullback in the market
11/5/20, 6:15 PM - Niteen: 👍
11/5/20, 6:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I own that too. Roku and TTD are driving connected TV ad market revolution. I have not discusses here because there has not been a good entry for like 5 months now
11/5/20, 6:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: *discussed
11/5/20, 6:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It has increased 400% since March low
11/5/20, 6:17 PM - +1 (727) 248-1546: Oh okay
11/5/20, 6:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Peloton is down 6% after market after delivering a monstrous quarter. I may initiate a small position tomorrow

11/5/20, 6:36 PM - Niteen: 👍 I have noticed it multiple times..even after beating expectations the share price goes down.. could you shed some light?

11/5/20, 6:38 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: It’s 9.6% up after mkt .. $63.60
11/5/20, 6:39 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: Cloudflare 9.6% up after mkt .. $63.60
11/5/20, 6:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: This one is because there is more demand than they can produce, which is a good thing and will keep momentum humming for quarters to come. 

On the other hand, for Fastly, they missed beat and reduced guidance, so got crushed, part of which was because market mispriced ut. They delivered 60% growth for 2nd quarter, market took it is sustainable and bid price up to $150, whereas if you look at it, they have always been growing in 40% range, so it was a one off push from covid.
11/5/20, 6:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So for each stock will be its own story. Sometimes its profit taking by short term momentum traders, sometimes its company specific issue
11/5/20, 6:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I typically don't like to buy when stock goes down after earnings, but I have been eyeing peloton for sometime now, so it will be a good opportunity. I never take a full position, so am happy if the stock declines further.
11/5/20, 6:45 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: 👍🏻

11/6/20, 11:45 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: US govt has to support Tesla to compete with NIO else this chinese company will overtake one day.
11/6/20, 11:48 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Do u think world believes chinese products?

11/6/20, 2:39 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Tlry at 10. Is it good price to enter?
11/6/20, 2:52 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: It is less than 10 now. I think good to keep some. It has potential to go $20. You can avg if go further down.

11/7/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am reducing my probability to reach the low again. The next pullback (back to low or not) will probably be good buying opportunity before we start our bullish journey to 4k, 4.5k and beyond. 

May the markets be with you 👍
11/7/20, 1:25 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It seems we are out of the woods finally....I am still holding 50% cash, any suggestion for folks like me 😁
11/7/20, 1:32 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: All Chinese stock should go up.
11/7/20, 1:34 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: My suggestion is to allocate cash on pullbacks on your shopping list. Couple of trends that I am bullish generally, more on Biden victory is clean energy, health and health tech, cannabis stocks (high risk sector), emerging market /Chinese etfs or stocks and my usual tech plays (expected to do well under any president)
11/7/20, 1:37 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I bought NIO, XPEV, Wynn and Marriott. Small position. Also a very small position in Peloton(based on Nash recommendation) and Palantir (for very short term to sell before result)...Let’s see.
11/7/20, 1:38 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: If you have to recommend one or two names growth stock with moderate risk?
11/7/20, 1:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I did not get a chance to enter Peloton as it spiked up. I am waiting but will buy soon.
11/7/20, 1:38 PM - +1 (781) 774-0196: <Media omitted>
11/7/20, 1:41 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I have add more. At what level I should? Market is betting 200 soon and it will never come down even after Covid. It’s a subscription based model like Netflix.
11/7/20, 1:41 PM - Niteen: That's great. Could you drop some symbols here too? That would help.
11/7/20, 1:42 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Exactly 🙂
11/7/20, 1:53 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash. Looking at the current scenario I doubt if there would be any pullback in near terms, once stimulus is announced, market will go even higher. 
Earlier this week I took position in Amazon and shop, my ord
11/7/20, 1:57 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: My other orders don’t get executed and now everything(sq, TTD) has rallied by 15-20%. Not sure if current levels are good to enter, I guess going through FOMO, not sure of the strategy going forward
11/7/20, 2:00 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Remember market always surprised... when everywhere green... stop and think..
11/7/20, 2:05 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Amy, I placed SQ order for 150 it reversed from 152, TTD for 550, it reversed from 555, now thinking should have bought and not waited for the order to get triggered.
The problem is may be I am thinking too much of the missed opportunities 😜
Not sure if it is good to hold on for now or to put 20-25% in the market at the current levels
11/7/20, 2:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It happens with everyone all the time. Though I still like to be disciplined, watch it for months, to get to the level I like.
11/7/20, 2:16 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: I think future is really big green but short term may be some surprise. If market is manipulated due to election than sure some correction in short term. This is my personal opinion.
11/7/20, 2:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
11/7/20, 2:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yes will do. Most of the times its addition to my existing position rather than a new one. Feel free to see my notes that I had provided here, and buy on pullbacks, all of which I consider to have  long term potential to be multibaggers in years to come.
11/7/20, 3:13 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Will try to be patient and see if some stock gives a buying opportunity, BABA is still down will try to make a position tomorrow
11/7/20, 3:15 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yaa currently everything has rallied it would be good if we get a dip like last Friday
11/7/20, 3:17 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I follow few of your stocks, I guess the list is SE, SHOP, Fiverr, Livongo+TDOC, Amazon, FB etc
11/7/20, 3:18 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: One thing I have noticed that you have never shared your views on SQ and Tesla, do you hold these stocks?
11/7/20, 3:29 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: I noticed mostly we have recommendations on Tech stocks. But aren't we putting all our eggs in one basket? Should we consider allocation in some other sectors as well? If yes, any recommendations?
11/7/20, 3:30 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I like square. 
I like Tesla's car :-) Jokes aside, I typically don't buy low margin, high capital intensive business, so Tesla is not for me though I get why some investors love this stock.
11/7/20, 3:31 PM - +1 (201) 884-0096: some suggestion for newbies like me ??? Stocks and their best price ranges to enter ...
11/7/20, 3:32 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 😁😁
11/7/20, 3:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yes, diversification is useful only to the point that its not diluting returns. I think looking generically as everything tech may not be the right way to look at things as each of the comanies are trying to conquer a different niche all of which together have secular tailwinds in their favour. 

Eg

Cord cutting - Roku

Programmatic Ad - Trade desk

Powering online small business - Shopify

Health tech/chronic disease management - Teladoc

Cloud native security- Crowdstrike

Edge computing - cloudfare, fastly

These are all tech stocks but have a totally different model and areas they serve.
11/7/20, 4:16 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: What’s you take on BotZ and ROBO for long term investment may be 4-5 yrs .. these are AI AND robotics etf
11/7/20, 4:16 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: ?
11/7/20, 4:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I like the industry, but difficult to comment given I am not aware of all the securities in the etf
11/7/20, 5:29 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: Lightspeed(LSPD) is a new company. They have could based POS and eCommerce(like Shopify).
Recently, the place where I work established the partnership with them. I think they have a good potential to grow. 
I entered at $29.
11/7/20, 5:36 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: Their main customers are restaurants and Bike stores. My PT is around $60 by spring.
11/7/20, 6:08 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Thanks. So even though these are tech companies they serve different Industries. So is the recommendation that we don't need to invest into other core companies from different sectors? I personally like tech companies especialty the kind of rally/growth they had in recent years. We don't see that kind of growth in other sectors like banking, cpg etc.
11/7/20, 7:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Every one has a different investing style, so it would not be wise for me to tell what you should or should not do. I can only tell you what I do - Only invest in winners that are either disrupting an existing industry or are seving a large and expanding addressable market, most times they happen to be part of the tech sector, but occasionally its can be from other sectors.
11/7/20, 7:41 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: 👍
11/7/20, 7:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Big commerce is also one that is growing in this space, because the industry is growing. That said, rather than diversifying in new companies, I like to allocate my capital into winners (Shopify) which is killing in this space. I have no reason to believe that anyone is eating Shop's lunch. For eg - I took a quick look and I see LSPD grew revenue at 60% in the most recent quarter with $45MM revenue, Shopify is growing at close to 100% with $700Mm in revenue (15 times as much revenue) 

Shopify also has an exhaustive suite of products and Tobi Lutke is a visionary. I have no doubt it will be the future Amazon. I have generated 10x return on this and if it continues, it will be my first 100x bagger/10,000% return (offcourse on my initial position)
11/7/20, 7:49 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Ok
11/7/20, 7:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I still buy shop when I get an opportunity, the latest was detailed here at $860
11/7/20, 7:55 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I also added shop at 900 on Monday, wished should have bought more, already up 16%+
11/7/20, 7:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍👌
11/7/20, 7:57 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Biplab sab khareed lijiyega kya kuch rehne bhi dijiye.. :-)
11/7/20, 7:58 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Jokes Apart if you are buying at 900 what is the expected target price for SHOP
11/7/20, 7:58 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: ?
11/7/20, 8:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If I would have set target, I would have sold in $200, $300, $500 or $1000. 

I will be invested as long as the company is winning and growing more than 20% per year.
11/7/20, 8:04 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I was tracking it since it was 600 in early May, all the valuation showed it was selling at a huge premium and hence never entered it, however now when I analyse it more I get more bullish towards it, their Walmart and FB deal seals the deal for me, would add more if get similar opportunities, this is going to be big, we just need to look beyond PE
11/7/20, 8:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Revenue growth of 20%, with operating leverage, eps growth of 25% would translate into 9-10x bagger return (Lynch and Buffet average) in 10 years.
11/7/20, 8:06 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Ok ..this is primarily for investment.. will try to investment something
11/7/20, 8:07 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Couldn’t buy many on Friday as was skeptical that market will fall more and give more buying opportunities but that dint happened and now I regret that I don’t put more money in the market on Friday/Monday, everything is 10%+ up on an average
11/7/20, 8:09 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Great .. mai unhi mazak kar raha tha ..dont mind
11/7/20, 8:09 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍
11/7/20, 8:09 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah looking at PE, you would have never bought Amazon, Netflix, Tesla and many of the great companies of our time. Wall St cannot price exponential growth stocks in the long run
11/7/20, 8:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Particulary at near zero rates
11/7/20, 8:12 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Completely agree, if we have the risk appetite and want to grow our money exponentially we should go for these growth stocks without any second thoughts. Else invest in Coca-Cola, BoA, Apple  and enjoy the safe investment and periodic dividend returns
11/7/20, 8:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
11/7/20, 8:14 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yea I know bro 😁 I was just explaining that I did miss the bus 😒😒 ab sir patak raha hu 😜😜😜
11/7/20, 8:14 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Haha
11/7/20, 8:34 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Any new investor who can put money and hold for next couple of years in above stocks + sq+ TSLA + Amazon+Zoom+ SE+Baba should be 100%+ up on least 4-5 stocks in my opinion, as this is stock market and comes with its own risks but these seems to be quite safe investments looking from their balance sheet/debt perspective. Currently most of them looks very expensive but this is what I have learnt from my last 6 months of experience. I might be wrong though, but if one has a long term view one can invest in these
11/7/20, 8:52 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: Totally agree. I bought small position of Shop at $324. I regret not going all in at that time. I think $870 is the level I may add more.
11/7/20, 8:54 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: The only reason I went ahead with LSPD is because Shop seems to be in consolidation phase and playing in $900 to $1000 range for along time and LSPD seems to be in gaining momentum.
11/7/20, 8:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍
11/7/20, 10:16 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Has anyone heard of Jeff Bezos selling 3 billion dollars worth of stock today? Will this affect the stock on Monday?
11/7/20, 10:21 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: According to Securities and Exchange Commission he sold it on mon and Tuesday.. it’s done ✅
11/7/20, 10:22 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: This was sold last week itself..... stock was selling at 2950-3100 then

11/8/20, 9:32 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Even Bezos couldn't time the market and sell his own company's stock at all time high. So we shouldn't be too disappointed when the stock goes up after we sell.
11/8/20, 9:40 AM - +1 (201) 673-2921: 😂

11/8/20, 12:26 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Bezos is visionary, selling to invest in the next big thing "space exploration". I dont think the intent is to time the market IMO.
11/8/20, 12:34 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 👍🏻
11/8/20, 12:37 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Yes, correct. I'm just joking about it that even richest man cannot time the market.
11/8/20, 1:58 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: He may not have time to time the market 🤣

11/8/20, 10:45 PM - +1 (408) 242-5192: Hello all,
It is a good time to consider buying airline stocks? At some point pandemic will be behind us and traveling will resume. Let’s say in one year.
I always travel with United. I thought maybe buy some UA ... keep long term. Or is it better to invest JETS which is mix of airlines?

11/9/20, 9:01 AM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Is it good time to add positions in these stocks ? Any suggestions
11/9/20, 9:02 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its broken support. Let the chart develop
11/9/20, 9:03 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Let the downside play it out
11/9/20, 9:03 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thank you. So will wait.
11/9/20, 9:03 AM - +1 (669) 235-0477: These vaccines will be going to test again and declare there results in the month end. That will decide actually whether this vaccine is viable
11/9/20, 9:03 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There will be ample opportunities

11/9/20, 10:28 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Initial position at $380, will continue to add if it keeps falling
11/9/20, 10:28 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It reversed from you buying point, how about 420? Does it look good
11/9/20, 10:29 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah its not off because I am looking at multi year hold
11/9/20, 10:30 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Again, not predicting a bottom, but will continue adding on declines, as I am trying to build a big position

11/9/20, 10:34 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I did not have limit orders on this one, but will most likely get some
11/9/20, 10:35 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Nasdaq is weak on a relative basis, i am pretty confident it will recover, but depends more on the broader market
11/9/20, 10:36 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Anyways position sizing is key, if this is a multi day downtrend or a day or two
11/9/20, 10:37 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Always have fire power for lower prices

11/9/20, 12:13 PM - +1 (224) 422-2950: Any recommendation for Fisker ? Already up 25%
11/9/20, 12:15 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: I feel it will be going up for the week since it is newly merged and the cars they are selling can compete with Tesla model 3 and Y because the Fisker Ocean is an SUV with 250-350 range and will increase soon as well with new battery technology.
11/9/20, 12:15 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: This is just my opinion

11/9/20, 12:19 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: May not be long term but based on vaccine news, I am assuming it should go up and atleast try to grab its position where it was before March.

11/9/20, 3:34 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: SHOP to $900,, is it good price to enter ??
11/9/20, 3:54 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I did buy shop at 900 a week back, but looking at current scenario I think it should fall further, I am going to buy more if it falls 10% to my buying price, you can decide accordingly
11/9/20, 3:56 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Guys did anyone buy recovery stocks in cruises, airline or hotels..... I guess it is time to start entering these, I did buy air Canada, wynn and RCL today, more or less at today’s peak as these are still 30-50% less than their peak, please share your purchases for today
11/9/20, 3:57 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: @14082425192 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
11/9/20, 4:03 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: Thanks Biplab... was quite vigilant to this as keep on hearing about this in this group.. entered at 900
11/9/20, 4:05 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: Airlines and cruise seems quite high today with upto 25% hike.. 

Not sure if we should purchase today or wait for few days to let this heat of momentum goes bit down 🤔🤔🤔
11/9/20, 4:05 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Nvidia is also down 6%, placed an order for 500, Let’s see if it gets executed tomorrow..... hoping nasdaq to fall tomorrow further as people are selling tech stocks to buy recovery stocks, we should get some good buying opportunities in tech stocks tomorrow as well
11/9/20, 4:06 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I still went ahead and made bought my first lot, if they fall will buy more else will add good tech stocks to my portfolio
11/9/20, 4:08 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: If you would look further most of these stocks are still selling at 30-50 discounted rate comparing to pre-Covid prices, and if the vaccine comes people gonna travel like hell, hence bought today at the peak, I might go completely wrong though ...
11/9/20, 4:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I own it at $60. Happy to own more if it falls more.
11/9/20, 4:14 PM - Niteen: So, basically Pfizer vaccine news brought this sale..market is reacting like pandemic is over.
11/9/20, 4:14 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Bad news: Gov. Newsom says that tomorrow the state will be announcing more restrictive requirements for many counties where COVID case rates have been climbing up. 

"Anticipate that we'll see some counties moving backwards," he says.


according to state data (Newsom didn't specify) these counties were failing to meet their benchmarks last week, so could be at risk: Trinity, San Francisco, San Diego, Amador, Contra Costa, Inyo, Yolo, Yuba, Mono, Sacramento, Santa Cruz, Stanislaus, Amador and more
11/9/20, 4:15 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Very confusing day
11/9/20, 4:15 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Any one has good time duration estimate on general availability of vaccine?
11/9/20, 4:18 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I guess so, look at the nasdaq and then the S&P 500, it is obvious that people are moving money from tech stocks to recovery stocks like airlines, cruises, hotels etc. AMC is up 60+%..... tomorrow is going to be super exciting
11/9/20, 4:23 PM - Niteen: The market is just reacting to the news..no clear roadmap/ timeline yet.
11/9/20, 4:24 PM - Niteen: Very soon NASDAQ stocks will be labeled as pandemic stocks ..🤣 including Zoom and Clorox 😜
11/9/20, 4:25 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yeah it’s just some light at the emd of the tunnel, but 90%+ positive response is raising the hopes across the world
11/9/20, 4:28 PM - Niteen: Yeah, that's what Pfizer CEO said..light at the end of tunnel.. irrespective of market situation, we all want this pandemic to end.
11/9/20, 4:28 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: BYND is 20% down AH

11/9/20, 4:42 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: In which case, I pray for Almaeda to close as well 🙂
11/9/20, 4:42 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I will love to buy Tesla at $350
11/9/20, 4:44 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 😂😂😂 have mercy in us invested folks....it is already consolidating for for last 2-3 months now
11/9/20, 4:44 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I will double pray for quick rise after I have bought in 🙂

11/9/20, 4:52 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Lmnd is up 7% today, is it because of the earning call this week or did they grab some good number of subscribers ? Anyone following it closely please share some intel so that we can act accordingly tomorrow
11/9/20, 4:56 PM - +1 (917) 406-2999: V bad day for market today, almost stocked dipped after initial upward trend. BYND, shop, Tesla, VRTX, MSFT, CRM, TWLO, Apple, DDOG, OSTK etc
11/9/20, 5:05 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It was a bad day for folks like us who are heavily dependent on tech(Nasdaq stocks ), there are many long term investors who averaged out their energy, travel and hospitality, entertainment during this Covid dip have gained significantly today after their 6-8 months of patience
11/9/20, 5:05 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: *Covid crash rather
11/9/20, 5:05 PM - +1 (669) 235-0477: 👍
11/9/20, 5:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I consider all of these as cyclical sectors, and while there may be an initial pop because of news, these sectors have generally turned out to be poor long term investments.
11/9/20, 5:23 PM - +1 (201) 699-2442: Hi Anand, please add +1 201 895 1056
11/9/20, 5:24 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Hi Anand, could you please add 408-466-7693 to the group
11/9/20, 5:29 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Agreed, but as most of these stocks are still trading at 30-50% discount, I chose to invest in the industry leaders for these sectors, and ready to hold for next year or so.
Having said that, my favourite are still the tech stocks as they innovate regularly which I like and my 80% portfolio will still be tech stocks no matter how the market behaves, in long run I am bullish about my tech investments
11/9/20, 5:37 PM - Niteen: I would like to see any kind of survey report in new future that would show how many ppl (general population) would sign up for vaccine...ppl still not  wearing masks.
11/9/20, 5:37 PM - Niteen: near* future
11/9/20, 5:41 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Agree. Maybe old people and one with comorbidities may sign up and will be first to receive one.
11/9/20, 5:42 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I don't think i am getting one for atleast a year or so
11/9/20, 5:43 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I hope Basement Biden doesn't force everyone to get vaccine by creating hurdles for traveling or access to public spaces

11/9/20, 8:39 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: People in my office were making fun that Pfizer is effective 90% and corona kills only 2-3% without vaccine. So taking Pfizer vaccines will kill more people 😀
11/9/20, 8:39 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: I think this euphoria will be short lived
11/9/20, 8:39 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: 😀 correct

11/10/20, 8:11 AM - +1 (773) 364-0061: good morning friends: one question. if i sell any stock on robinhood how many days it takes to get that money credited so that i can transfer that to my bank account
11/10/20, 8:12 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Max 2-3 days unless a weekend or holidays come in between. 
If you want to invest in other stocks, most brokers allow you to buy using the “pending” funds.
11/10/20, 8:12 AM - +1 (773) 364-0061: i sold some stocks yesterday and still dont see the money available to be transferr to my bank accnt
11/10/20, 8:12 AM - +1 (773) 364-0061: ook thanks
11/10/20, 8:13 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I think 1 day for RH
11/10/20, 8:13 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: for Fidelity it takes 2-3 days
11/10/20, 8:14 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: For me it’s immediate in RH and 1-2 days to Bank 🏦
11/10/20, 8:21 AM - +1 (972) 754-6465: Probably you account might have above 25k . It is Day trading account . Funds will be available immediately after sold. If less than 25 k it takes 2 business days for funds available.
11/10/20, 9:29 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: As u may remember, I took 50% position in Wynn, Marriott on Friday and have an advantage of Monday rally...I will wait for a pull back to add more. My experience it generally pulls back after a super rally. I had some options in carnival, Wynn, that sold yesterday in profit (was at huge loss before yesterday rally). Have some more positions with loss (option) in carnival, and jets that I will exit as soon as there is one more rally. I believe yesterday’s momentum will cool down and gain again when either Moderna announces success or Pfizer’s vaccine gets emergency use approval may be by end of this week.
11/10/20, 9:30 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Correction. End of this month.
11/10/20, 9:31 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Do you have gold subscription for RH? That could be the reason funds are available immediately for you.
11/10/20, 9:33 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: As long as you are ok to wait upto June/July next year, it should be a profitable buy.
11/10/20, 9:34 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Lucky you to buy on Friday and enjoying the rally on Monday 👍👍
11/10/20, 9:36 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Just add now since it’s significantly down because of COVID and exit after vaccine. I agree not a long term stock but definitely a short to medium term opportunity.
11/10/20, 9:36 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yaa, plus it was my initial position will add more at every 10% up/down and hold it for long term 1-2 year
11/10/20, 9:38 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: What does this mean probability that 90% of 2-3%’s life will be saved.
11/10/20, 9:40 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Once in a blue moon luck :):).
11/10/20, 9:40 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Baba down. I entered at 270
11/10/20, 9:46 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: With moderna vaccine also about to be out before end of this year, all Covid stocks are falling and might continue the fall for next few days as well, hence we should be cautious and buy in phases and keep cash for the longest possible period.
11/10/20, 9:46 AM - Niteen: Covid stocks 🤣😂

11/10/20, 10:14 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I think amount is available immediately for next trade but to withdraw to your bank account it is only after 1 day. That is what is happening with me. My account has more than 25k but yes I am not gold member.

11/11/20, 12:19 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Just a thought. If anyone was looking to enter boeing and couldn't enter yday, there is a good chance today. 182-183 zone should act as a good support today and stock should bounce from here... Technically bcos of the positive news next week, if 195 breaks then we can see 225.

If anyone wants to take a chance for next week expiry it can be done today...

11/11/20, 2:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It as perfectly normal for tech stocks to have 10% to even 50% drawdown, because they got up a few hundred percent. 

Volatility is the price of admission.
11/11/20, 2:49 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: As per me, TDOC has nothing to do with the Covid, it helps patients to her consultation remotely and they will continue to do that, at least for seasonal stuff which are not very critical.
Just to get an antibiotic subscribes during cold, currently folks have to take leave, go and see the doctor and waste at least few hours, TDOC provides solution to this
11/11/20, 2:50 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: And hence I added few more during this dip/crash
11/11/20, 2:50 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Then there is a rubber band pull commonly known as TA as oversold condition. If you fall hard, you go up fast. Doesn't say if its bottom, but reveals the fundamental character of the stock

11/12/20, 10:19 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Seems like Zoom reversed from my earlier level of $380 (lowest close of $376), Datadog after posting fantastic results yesterday  was down and reversed from $80 (closed at $86, but reversed from a low of $79.76). 

My numbers are important, and it should work (most times) under normal market conditions.
11/12/20, 10:27 AM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Zoom is already at 430$ now looks like we missed the bus to add more position 😢
11/12/20, 10:28 AM - +1 (201) 673-2921: *420$
11/12/20, 10:32 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Datadog results

-Q3 sales up 61% to $155MM (beat of 6%), eps beat of few hundred percent, raised guidance by 6%

- New customers who will contribute more than $100k is up 50% 

- Launched 8 new products. Partnership with Azure and Google cloud, which will allow their customer to buy its product, revenue for which will start accruing in the 4th quarter.

- Stock was down because of lower guidance of 44% in Q-4, but they will likely beat it and be close to 50% growth.
11/12/20, 10:35 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Who knows there is another tech meltdown (the great value rotation). If Nasdaq is falling from the sky, it's possible for Zoom to go to $325-$350, providing last opportinity. Lets see.
11/12/20, 10:35 AM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Is it good buy at current price ?
11/12/20, 10:38 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: For short term trading - I don't know.
For long term - why not, but the intent should not be to buy all at once and wait for dips to add.
11/12/20, 10:38 AM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Ok 👍
11/12/20, 10:47 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Looks like today is XPEV and NIO term to 🚀. Sold Planntir. Keeping all....Is it time to add more Marriott and Wynn??? Your opinion please.

11/12/20, 10:55 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Any take on BYND, planning to make a position, I think it is short term dip looking at a lifestyle and food habit changes in youth, this stock should give us good returns in long term

11/12/20, 10:57 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Bhai, I run away from cyclical stocks. My understanding is that there are challenges to vaccine development (limited amount will be available for most at risk population and then there are challenges of freezing). Understandably, if economy does not get back in full steam, the stocks may be vulnerable for next quarter results or may be next. While they look beaten down in their charts and price may go up or down based on news flows rather than fundamentals.
11/12/20, 10:59 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I look at daily candles and daily close while charting.
11/12/20, 10:59 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I took a token position position at 123 the day it was down.
11/12/20, 11:01 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It might have a delta of few % age I guess than
11/12/20, 11:02 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Great, it does look a good opportunity, will make an entry too
11/12/20, 11:02 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: My view is that it will shot up again the day Pfizer emergency use authorization news comes/Moderna 3rd phase success result by Nov end beginning Dec...That will be the day to exit if you want short term gain.
11/12/20, 11:03 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I have a small position in wynn, air Canada and RCL, all are red 😜😜😜
11/12/20, 11:05 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Today bought one option of Wynn Mar19th $120 call for $340. Same call I sold for $800 on Pfizer day news.
11/12/20, 11:05 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: The tech stocks are already green for me .... so I am not adding more to the above stocks at least for now, if they fall 10-15% than only I will think to add more
11/12/20, 11:09 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Probably you bought on the big Monday. I had recommended to wait as generally it cools down :). But I believe you will earn profit within a month....I did same mistake buying bunch of tech stock on the same day and mostly in red as it further declined next day as well.  We need to learn to CONTROL THE IMPULSIVE BUYING and have patience 😀.
11/12/20, 11:10 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👆Patience is the name of the game
11/12/20, 11:12 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Very true. But hard to exercise 🙂. That’s the one piece I am trying to learn.
11/12/20, 11:13 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: If there is one thing I have learnt  over the years it is you cannot make money if you're impatient.
11/12/20, 11:15 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: That’s right I did buy on peak on Monday, I thought that the rally will continue for days so don’t want to miss the bus. Should have been patient
11/12/20, 11:17 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Right patience is virtue and buying in phases is the key, I implemented the second one successfully hence ok to see these stocks go down further
11/12/20, 11:17 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: American Well...Earning result today...keep the stock or sell???
11/12/20, 11:18 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: So true.
11/12/20, 11:18 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Stocks that you dont buy on that days peak.... will continue to scale new peaks.... Ones that are bought corrects next day 😃
11/12/20, 11:19 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Similar to lane change theory. The lane you are driving will move the slowest 🙂🙂.
11/12/20, 11:19 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I think there is a fine line, one needs to be aggresive  (Impatient) in cutting losers, and patient in adding to winners (when they fall)

So along with having patience, one should be able to distinguish between winner and loser.
11/12/20, 11:22 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: This is a new thing that I will have to learn, as today’s losers might be tomorrow’s winners, and most often whenever I move out of a position it goes up, so getting into a habit of not selling my positions till I need money or want to distribute the profit in another potential stock to buy
11/12/20, 11:22 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: So three stock principles so far...
1)- Have patience,
2)- Buy in phases, and
3)- Don’t be imotional with booking loss and cutting losers. 
Good learning :).
11/12/20, 11:23 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Any view on this plz?
11/12/20, 11:25 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Entered today at 127
11/12/20, 11:26 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I define losers as one with stagnant or declining  sales and profit growth in an industry that is getting disrupted (retail, energy) and the company not changing with the demands of its market.

Price action is one piece, the other important piece is fundamentals.
11/12/20, 11:28 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I missed the boat earlier this year when it went from about $100 to almost $200. It's back at March levels now. UBS has a target price of $107 though
11/12/20, 11:32 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Understood, I found wynn, RCL and Air Canada to be a better in comparison to others in their respective industry segments hence I put some money there not selling as in case the execution plan for the vaccine comes out, these should go up in near term
11/12/20, 11:36 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks for sharing, I bought first lot, let’s see how it goes
11/12/20, 11:40 AM - +1 (408) 396-9658: Even Li inc going up
11/12/20, 11:54 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Good morning $16k BTC
11/12/20, 12:37 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Unfortunately I am not on virtual currency. Once entered ling back and booked loss. Hopefully will get an opportunity to enter.
11/12/20, 3:06 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: SNOW coming to our target price $220
11/12/20, 3:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Will you buy at that price?
11/12/20, 3:54 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: Still overpriced🤔
11/12/20, 3:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I dont disagree. What should be the price?
11/12/20, 5:23 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: Initially I thought IPO on $70 was overpriced. Still I say somewhere around $100 is good which is not seems to be possible.
This overpriced is due to blackiers 😂 remember college days, Raja Hindustani movie released and tickets on black which was illegal but in stock market... You know it.

Big guns got stocks on lower price and they made it overpriced.

I would still wait and watch how Snowflake is doing in the market.
11/12/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (516) 653-8250: Praveen ji watch Harshad Mehta scam web series. Exactly whts happening here
11/12/20, 6:04 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: SNOW opened at $320 and currently trading at $230, which is 30% lower than were they opened. 

Some of the best investors in the world got it at $120 price. Thats the floor. I dont like to say "ever" ever, but happy to bet that stock will not breach this level. 

There is a premium public market pays. It always does. So the question is what should be the premium? Lets put a few data point -

- The lowest analyst price is $175.

- If I use TA and do a fibonnaci retracement, I get slightly below $200

- If I use the fastest and the most expensive stock in the market as a comp, I get $150. 

So I sense it should be some number between the 3 above. What is the final number? I dont know but we will be able to figure out when it reaches there.
11/12/20, 6:17 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Need to read what happened at that time. I was pretty young then, but remember hearing his name on the news every day. Any movies made on his story?
11/12/20, 6:20 PM - +1 (609) 442-9779: There is a popular web series in amazon prime SCAM
11/12/20, 6:21 PM - +1 (929) 215-4132: That company is still thr I guess Growmore

11/13/20, 9:35 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: The rally should go till 17th at least, ppl are betting high on Chinese EV companies post XPeng good results
11/13/20, 10:10 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Is it good time to enter xpeng?

11/13/20, 10:22 AM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Tesla will strike back 😎
11/13/20, 10:24 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: The way these Chinese EVs are rallying it looks like they will go to the moon, but if they fall the late entrants will lose most of the money, you can try your luck by putting some small amount, I did put in nio earlier this week, so far it’s going good
11/13/20, 10:25 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Not sure if Tesla short sellers are buying these Chinese stocks to bring down Tesla stock... just a speculation
11/13/20, 10:56 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Factory shutdown fear
11/13/20, 11:02 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: It started coming down 😀

11/13/20, 11:45 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: But wait for Nov 17
11/13/20, 11:45 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: I might have just rushed
11/13/20, 11:46 AM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Is it ok to make a small position in NiO right now cause of the high price at
11/13/20, 11:53 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 12 month price forecasts by analysts have a median target of 155 and high estimate of 310 and low estimate of 44.12. am not an expert , however going by the expectation/forecast, should be ok to have a small position,
11/13/20, 11:54 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Is this for NIO?
11/13/20, 11:55 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Yes

11/13/20, 12:10 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Yes start with small position, as experts say when dips improve/add to your position

11/13/20, 12:34 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I just find this ridiculous. Would be shocked if it keeps going up. Yesterday sold a few at $48
11/13/20, 12:34 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Having said that who knows anything is possible
11/13/20, 12:34 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 👍
11/13/20, 12:35 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Is it a good trade move to Trust this Chinese stock .. ?
11/13/20, 12:58 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: The worst scenario for Chinese stocks was few months back when there were rumours in the market that trump is going to delist all the Chinese stocks from US markets, that was the time I sold my Nio stocks at $6, and now bought it back at $42, I think scenario is better now, and the way markets are crazy about EV companies, even NKLA shot to $90 without any in production product, Nio still has some cars on the roads .... looks like a decent bet, I am following the saying “Dar ke aage jeet hai” hence put a small chunk in Nio which I am ready to lose, you can take your call too.
11/13/20, 1:04 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I have also observed one thing that valuations doesn’t matter these days, markets are factoring 4-5 years of growth in the current stock prices for most of the growth stocks, not sure if this is a bubble but ppl are making hell lot of money in this market with so much of ups and downs. 
Investors are gaining 10+ years of experience in just few months of investing in the current market, it could be a bubble or it could be a long term bull market even with so much of negativity around .... good time to be here and learn stuff
11/13/20, 1:05 PM - +1 (917) 406-2999: Vrtx is up @227 from 218 yesterday

11/13/20, 3:15 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Another short seller report seems to be the catalyst for this sell off for Nio
11/13/20, 3:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Nasdaq PE was 175 during the peak of 2000, when every company just added dotcom to their name and they used to shoot few hundred percent. Fed fund rate was around 4.5% (meaning the discount rate was higher to value these companies and you use to get much higher return investing in bonds as an alternative to stocks) 

Today the Nasdaq PE is 35, and most of the companies have real earnings behind them and Fed fund rate is close to 0 (forward bonds returns are subpar at best and poor investment alternative compare to equities) 

IMO, we are in a bull market. We will reach yhe bubble stage in the next couple to few years, till that time, fasten the seat belt and enjoy the ride.
11/13/20, 3:19 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks for clearing the air Nash as always!

11/13/20, 3:52 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Anyone looking at baba? I feel it deserves a bounce back soon.  Stock is approaching oversold levels. All Chinese retail stocks like pdd and jd also doing well.

11/13/20, 5:28 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Story of one of my trade from this week..

After I  came out within an hour .. it went to .38 and today eod price is .75  which eqautes to $2150 

Timing.. bad luck

I own shares at $190 at a 40% profit. I am considering selling it given heightened regulatory risk.
11/13/20, 9:38 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: It's like fighting with FED.

11/17/20, 2:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Amazon is trillion dollar gorilla, but this is a huge market for multiple companies to survive and thrive.  Ask how etsy has done when Amazon came with handmade. 

No positions yet, but I am looking at Goodrx seriously and will take a position after the fall is over.
11/17/20, 2:50 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Just came out of FCEL with some profit
11/17/20, 2:50 PM - +1 (408) 396-9658: Is it good to a investment now ?
11/17/20, 2:51 PM - +1 (408) 396-9658: As amazon will do it I am thinking in a positive note ..
11/17/20, 2:51 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: I had RIOT .. sold it for a break even last week :-( and now it is flying high
11/17/20, 2:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Let it stop falling, there is ample opportunity even if you above 10% higher
11/17/20, 2:54 PM - +1 (408) 396-9658: Correct

11/17/20, 4:13 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: yeah, my portfolio is highly volatile today 😄
11/17/20, 4:14 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: Same here 😀

11/17/20, 5:09 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: What should be the strategy , hold the stocks for long, more dip enter again and avg out
11/17/20, 5:10 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Surprisingly Stock dint fall, investors were expecting it to turn profitable this quarter.... good for us, I thought it would go back to 30s at least if not 20s. 
Quite good performance in all, looks like a winner in making.
11/17/20, 5:12 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 2.19 pc down after hours
11/17/20, 5:13 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It’s negligible in comparison to the run up it had in last few weeks.
11/17/20, 5:14 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Yep👍
11/17/20, 5:16 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I am holding and will accumulate more on dips, it has faired well and as is being supported by Chinese government( battery swap incentives) and 4th quarter being the best for automotive sector because of festivities, may be next quarter it will turn profitable too, I might go wrong though
11/17/20, 5:16 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Any reason for this ? Sept earnings were not particularly good.

11/17/20, 6:36 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: US Healthcare market is expensive, complicated and confusing. Goodrx provide a unique service which makes healthcare more affordable for its consumers. Some of the things I like 

- Massive TAM - Management estimate it to be $800 bn (I take it with grain of salt but nonetheless its huge)

- #1 medical app in the App store, 15Mm users with 80% repeat activity, database of 70k pharmacy. 90 Net promoter score (allows word of mouth publicity), the best that you would see and beats Amazon, Netflix, Disney. 

- 38% revenue growth (beat) with 95%+ Gross margins in the most recent quarter which was a beat. 

- Partnership with Kroger savings card (membership plan), working with manufacturers on ad revenue on their platform, launched heydoctor (telehealth service like teladoc)

- Founder led CEO with experience in product development in Facebook.

Also, just to remind, It took 2 years for Amazon to launch this service after it acquired Pillpack suggest that Amazon has been slow to this game, while Goodrx has been doing this for 15 years and have a massive customer database (they  aggregate 200 bn prescription price today). 

We have also seen other areas where Amazon had entered and while there is an initial reaction to sell,  the leaders in their fields have been competing well with Amazon (Etsy vs handmade, Netflix vs prime videos, Kindle with Apple or Google products, SpaceX with blue origin). Goodrx is good at what it does and it will not be a walk in the park IMO.
11/17/20, 7:20 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Thanks Nash ! This is helpful. Any particular price you are looking at to enter ? Or are you going by the momentum ?
11/17/20, 7:23 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Gr8 insight 👍

11/17/20, 7:33 PM - +1 (502) 296-0435: Nashji just amazing 🙏
11/17/20, 7:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its possible they struggle in the near term, so I will wait for price to rebound or will wait it out until the fall it completes
11/17/20, 7:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Back of the envelope calc suggest some support at $34-34.50. We will see of that holds and reverses from there.
11/17/20, 7:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Or if it breaks, lower prices ahead
11/17/20, 7:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its a new ipo, and todays price is the lowest ever, which makes this tricky to find a bottom. Lets see
11/17/20, 7:45 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Price is 20% lower than 52 weeks low. That was enough for me to jump in and start having position!
11/17/20, 7:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Hmm, I hope this rebounds quickly, but given how growth stocks have struggled recently, its entirely possible market may wait for earnings or management interview to figure out a direction. 

Short term pain but possibly long term gain
11/17/20, 7:57 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Good analysis, as usual. Same story with PTON, the day Apple and Amazon announced they are coming up with similar subscription service, PTON dropped to 80 but now rose to 100. Big players entering the game just endorses the business model.
11/17/20, 7:58 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: It’s a new IPO, it doesn’t have 52 weeks of history.
11/17/20, 7:59 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You know what I mean 😀
11/17/20, 7:59 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 👍🏻
11/17/20, 8:04 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Great analogy
11/17/20, 8:28 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Awesome !!! I never took this company seriously. Now, I will !
11/17/20, 10:33 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Can you plz let us know (same day 🙂) when you take your first position!
11/18/20, 1:01 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Great info Nash as always... it looks so tempting after knowing this, would have invested right away if the markets would have opened 😜😜, jokes apart definitely need to add to the watchlist. Thanks for sharing.
11/18/20, 7:25 AM - +1 (310) 748-7761: Thank you for your insight , Nash

11/18/20, 7:33 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Looks like investors already knew about the approval
11/18/20, 7:33 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Its flying
11/18/20, 7:35 AM - +1 (310) 748-7761: Yea.. thinking it will go further up
11/18/20, 7:35 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: I sold my $195 11/27 call yesterday 😭
11/18/20, 7:54 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not surprisingly, 2 new downgrades for GDRX between $29-$31. Its not a good idea to bottom fish, but let it find its price and stabilize.
11/18/20, 7:55 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I guess you are right!
11/18/20, 8:03 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: GDRX ...I have sold puts for 34 not sure if i will get assigned .. seems like if that happens GDRX is a good one to keep ..correct?

11/18/20, 9:07 AM - +1 (425) 306-3642: Upper Price to book profit in BA?

11/18/20, 11:11 AM - +1 (669) 235-0477: What do you think about BABA, AMZN, and ZOOM,? Will it bounce back to normal, if not normal then at least average standings?

11/18/20, 12:39 PM - +1 (408) 396-9658: GDRX is it right time to do the investment?
11/18/20, 12:40 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It’s below 34, @Nash please suggest
11/18/20, 12:43 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Did my first ever entry in Tesla today🙂. Having good feel about it. S&P entry will do the charm.
11/18/20, 12:44 PM - +1 (408) 396-9658: Amazon means no doubt one of the potential stock to go for . But need suggestions from all
11/18/20, 12:44 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I also bought BJs today. They have result tomorrow.

11/18/20, 12:50 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: super 👍
11/18/20, 12:54 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Hold on, its the 2nd day and I am looking for a multi-year opportunity. Bottom fishing may or may not be adequate for this one, because it's below IPO price and we don't know where it finally land up (support). I will be investing only when the trend reverses, even if it means buying 10% higher.
11/18/20, 12:55 PM - +1 (408) 396-9658: Hmmm
11/18/20, 12:55 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash, just keep us posted
11/18/20, 12:55 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I have bought additional GDRX .. twice at 34.25 and 33.85. I think it has to go up from here.
11/18/20, 12:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The safest way is to see if there is dent on earning results or guidance for next year.
11/18/20, 12:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its entirely possible that Amazon may have near term impact on Q4 earnings and this goes down another 10%
11/18/20, 12:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Normally, I watch stocks for months and months to see what it is doing before buying.
11/18/20, 12:57 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: My feeling is that there is play for every company. Walmart Target are doing very well even though amazon is out there.
11/18/20, 12:58 PM - +1 (972) 989-0421: i remember AMZN messed up APRN when it bot WHolefoods couple of days ahead of APRN IPO...so better to wait
11/18/20, 12:58 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Do we have earning call coming ?
11/18/20, 12:58 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Just because Amazon linked Pillpack with Prime doesn’t mean all other businesses will go down the drain
11/18/20, 1:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I mentioned my view because it was applicable for the moment yesterday, but its in a watchlist like SNOW is there for a few months now, but it wouldn't mean if its out of the woods (you know what I mean) 🙂
11/18/20, 1:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: After 3 mos
11/18/20, 1:00 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I totally get it

11/18/20, 1:01 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: And based on individual risk appetite
11/18/20, 1:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep
11/18/20, 1:06 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 😳😳 that’s quite far, their management should clear the air before that else this stock might continue to crash

11/18/20, 5:56 PM - Niteen: Nice insight 👍  What's your take on PLTR?
11/18/20, 6:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Palantir is a very unique company with lot of Govt contract, seems to help helped US govt with counter terrorism measure, human trafficking and other data intelligence that differentiates it for anything that is in the public market. In addition, they also provide very unique dataset to corporations which may have a lot of utility for them.  Some of the famed investors invested in it and they are reasonably valued, all if it is recipe for outperformance. 

One of the things that kept me on the sidelines is Govt owns ability to develop this intelligence, their ability or inability to share this data with private company and estimating the impact on revenue if they build a solution in-house. Its a complex business that I dont fully understand, so I may not invest. If the relation continue to improve with their customers, they may do very well.
11/19/20, 8:08 AM - Niteen: Thanks Nash for sharing your thoughts 👍

11/19/20, 8:56 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Palantir also works with Indian government agencies.
11/19/20, 8:59 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Don't know why george soros was invested in palantir. One side he funds Urban naxals in India, but also invests in company that provides data analytics capabilities to Indian intelligence agencies fighting naxals.
11/19/20, 8:59 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: So pltr - should we get rid of it?
11/19/20, 9:06 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: <Media omitted>
11/19/20, 9:07 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It's difficult to model palantir business model. But it should have deeply entrenched products with steady cashflows. Is s3 out?
11/19/20, 9:08 AM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Sorry s1 filings
11/19/20, 9:08 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Well, ethics are completely relative. Some people might find data collection by google and Apple is also unethical.
11/19/20, 9:10 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Few of fellow Indians might also consider investing in Chinese companies is unethical, especially because of the land grabbing policies of China in the region.
11/19/20, 9:11 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: So ethics and business doesn’t mix well.
11/19/20, 9:52 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Solo crossed $8
11/19/20, 9:53 AM - +1 (908) 672-5619: What r you doing for solo anand
11/19/20, 9:54 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: same what we are doing..trading 😀
11/19/20, 9:55 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Has anyone looked at RIDE ? any opinion?
11/19/20, 9:59 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Ayro crossed $5
11/19/20, 9:59 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bhai log GDRX hit $38
11/19/20, 9:59 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 37.99 to be precise
11/19/20, 9:59 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Coty crossed $6
11/19/20, 10:00 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Arre sarkar ..  cross karne se pehle bataiye to kuch fayda bhi ho entry lekar .. cross karne ke baad mamla sirf miss karne ka dukh deta hai .. 😆 hahah waise aur upar jayega kya?
11/19/20, 10:01 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: yeah I suggested this earlier....Ayro and Solo and related to EV....going fast...you can still enter.
11/19/20, 10:02 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Bahut bahut sukriya
11/19/20, 10:28 AM - Niteen: 😜😃
11/19/20, 10:42 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I would disagree. More corporations are trying achieve a right balance by allocating capital to companies that have strong ESG practice. Its because stakeholders to clients to regulators are asking tough questions. Just see the growth of the ESG funds over the years. I also went through a study showing ethical companies outperform by a significant margin over the long term. Happy to discuss more.
11/19/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Great Anand, congratulations on the quick gain, it takes lots of courage to enter in penny stocks and you are finding the right ones👍👍
11/19/20, 10:47 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Seems like numbers work again. Close of 33.76, 24 cents off. Let's see if it continues to hold
11/19/20, 10:48 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I watching these 2 from last 3-4 months. Finally getting profit and to all make your own decision to enter. It may or may not be for long term.
11/19/20, 10:48 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I was*
11/19/20, 10:48 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
11/19/20, 10:48 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: What else are you watching currently 😜😜😜
11/19/20, 10:49 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Coty is one I wrote earlier
11/19/20, 10:49 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I will also start watching and enter early😁😁
11/19/20, 10:50 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Coty is in cosmetic and fashion field
11/19/20, 10:50 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Could you share some more insight to your bull case scenario
11/19/20, 10:53 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Chaliye Anand bhai 50 shares le liye. Aapka research...Mera risk/reward. Jab aap nikle to Hume bata dijiye.
11/19/20, 10:53 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Coty has good Q3 earnings. It is already at the bottom level from where it was in last 3-4 years....so chances of recovering is high.
11/19/20, 10:54 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: It also hit badly in COVID.....I think Vaccine news and earning result bringing it up again.
11/19/20, 10:54 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Lets see how long it will go....my entry was at $3.5
11/19/20, 11:01 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks for sharing Anand
11/19/20, 11:01 AM - Niteen: That's the biggest distinction- GDRX Marketplace Vs. Amazon Pharmacy. Thanks for sharing it Nash 👍
11/19/20, 11:01 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍
11/19/20, 11:03 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: May be the CEO read my comments from the group yesterday where in urged the management to come forward and clear the air 😂😂😂, thanks for sharing Nash
11/19/20, 11:04 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Are you entering now or continue to wait
11/19/20, 11:06 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Still don't fully agree with his comment. Agree that its a pharmacy but its a discounted pharmacy which reduces the importance of Goodrx
11/19/20, 11:08 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Why not just make an entry with a small position and wait, as you mentioned that you don’t own this stock yet
11/19/20, 11:09 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yes will do soon
11/19/20, 11:09 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Speculative position
11/19/20, 11:09 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 1/3 or 1/4 position
11/19/20, 11:09 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Cool
11/19/20, 11:10 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Baniye ka dimag aur miyanbhai ki daring 🤪👍🏻... Unique combination
11/19/20, 11:16 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: TTD has recovered today
11/19/20, 11:17 AM - +1 (669) 235-0477: Also twillio and nikola up 7%
11/19/20, 11:22 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Market is going good, all my positions I entered during the last two weeks are green.
And a stimulus package hasn’t arrived yet, market looks good to go even higher from here once that is announced and Biden joins White House.
Any suggestion on what percentage of cash to hold in current scenario.
11/19/20, 11:28 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I always like to keep 20%+, in case I need it
11/19/20, 11:29 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There is a risk that market may come to 3300-3450
11/19/20, 11:29 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So I have a third of my portfolio in safe investments
11/19/20, 11:30 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Some of it will be deployed if it reaches the above
11/19/20, 11:30 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Otherwise I am happy with current allocation
11/19/20, 11:32 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash, I am 90% invested, went greedy 😁😁 but will keep the rest now for next buying opportunity
11/19/20, 11:39 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah that's me because I consider myself a  conservative investor (keep high cash, minimize investing in speculative companies, invest rather than trade, stay away from options generally, focus on position sizing). 

All of it is because I am super focused on capital preservation, which I think is very important for building capital over long term.
11/19/20, 11:39 AM - +1 (425) 786-5518: 👍🏻
11/19/20, 11:40 AM - Niteen: 👍👌
11/19/20, 11:42 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 👍
11/19/20, 11:43 AM - +1 (773) 364-0061 left
11/19/20, 11:47 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Ahhh...At this point 0% my position. Will try to sell and accumulate some cash over next two weeks.
11/19/20, 11:50 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yaa one day would like to gain these characteristics and have control and be less impulsive. 
There were few purchases during the dip made me learn a lot. TTD is one of them, when it came down from 819 to 775 I entered the stock and then it kept falling, bought few at 730, and then at 700, it ended up becoming a large position in my portfolio which I wasn’t prepared for. Zoom was another one, entered at 417 and had to buy again at 370
I think I am little better prepared for next dip, transacting a stock properly and at the right time is very critical and for that patience is the key.
11/19/20, 11:53 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: 👍
11/19/20, 11:56 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: All good stuff guys, this group is doing quite well and are becoming better investors by the day 👍
11/19/20, 12:04 PM - Niteen: TDOC is coming back to life..
11/19/20, 12:08 PM - Niteen: Thanks Biplab for sharing. It happened to me as well when I entered FSLY and then increased my position . I was able to erase that loss with FVRR...FVRR had an amazing run in last few days.
11/19/20, 12:09 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yaa good to see, the stock has taken lot of beating since it announced Livongo acquisition, hoping it to attain its peak of 250 and beyond in next few quarters
11/19/20, 12:10 PM - Niteen: Would love to see 250 + 😃
11/19/20, 12:12 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yaa.. FVRR was a great buy at those 140ish levels two weeks back... some profit booking has started though I guess
11/19/20, 12:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
11/19/20, 12:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 2021
11/19/20, 12:15 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Amen 🙏
11/19/20, 12:15 PM - Niteen: Absolutely..as you say *Patience is the name of the game* 😃
11/19/20, 12:17 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: BYND is slowly gaining too... it has gained 13%+ post the earning call dip
11/19/20, 12:18 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Or crash rather😜
11/19/20, 12:19 PM - +1 (669) 235-0477: I save my self from big loss is by adapting @12015655130’s theory. I made couple of wrong moves and those stocks are down since i bought, then it dipped an i bought again. At this point i was out of cash.

So i waited as nash always says, and made profit from other stocks and believed in my stocks and invested more in dip in multiple phases. 
Now i am out of all those stocks with atleast 4-10% profit
11/19/20, 12:19 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: ❤️. I have a small position. For short term n
11/19/20, 12:20 PM - Niteen: Super 👌👍 Nash Theory 😜
11/19/20, 12:21 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍
11/19/20, 12:23 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: As long as its a good quality stock (good management, sales growth, margins, secular industry, balance sheet), ok to average, if not its best to stay away from losers
11/19/20, 12:25 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: yes Avg is good strategy....even I came out from several stocks by averaging.....one big fat profitable stock is NIO where I started buying with $9 in 2018 keep averaging with $2 and brought it till $4 avg price....now sitting on more than $45 😀.
11/19/20, 12:25 PM - +1 (732) 799-8114: 👍

11/19/20, 12:31 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: another example here....my loss reduced to 20% now....I hope I'll come out in profit.
11/19/20, 12:31 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Nikola
11/19/20, 12:31 PM - +1 (419) 215-2329: Obviously whoever is having positive networth. Beggar
11/19/20, 12:32 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: nice one 🙂
11/19/20, 12:32 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Nio is my biggest blunder, the day I bought it rumour came that trump is going to delist Chinese companies from US markets, and I just sold them all ...... it was $6 and I had 400 of those ....
11/19/20, 12:35 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: <Media omitted>
11/19/20, 12:35 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Should have added speculative position yesterday .. it was 30% down from the lowest. $33.5 to $37.99. Sometimes it’s okay to take little risk!
11/19/20, 12:36 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: That’s a great strategy!
11/19/20, 12:39 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: ohh...all luck factor
11/19/20, 12:39 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: That’s handsome gain!
11/19/20, 12:42 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yepp, but it depends if you are buying for a short term gain or you want to evaluate the potential of 2x-3x in the stock over next couple of years and then only invest in it and if later is the case paying 5-10% more doesn’t matter when the stock becomes 2x-3x
11/19/20, 12:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s hard to find stocks that will double or triple in two years!
11/19/20, 12:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: This year has been different
11/19/20, 12:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Normally it’s like finding a needle in haystack
11/19/20, 12:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Who would expect NIO to jump from
1.5 to 50 just by selling 5000 cars a month
11/19/20, 12:45 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: value is much bigger than GM or Ford.. it’s all speculation
11/19/20, 12:45 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Every car that Tesla sells adds 1mn to market value
11/19/20, 12:45 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Is it justified?
11/19/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Market is all speculation! Too much money. People are ready to take risks and place bets!
11/19/20, 12:54 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Imagine - Tesla reports profit in a quarter stock goes up 15%. Any positive news means 10% up just in after hour. If you ask me personally Tesla should be a $100 stock but I don’t control it. Zoom at $588 is it justified? None of these makes sense. SHOP over $1000. There are many lee cases. I personally feel market is overvalued and must drop 20-30% to have right levels.
11/19/20, 12:54 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: That’s true the investment technique seems to be going through an inflection point from value to speculation based investing.
Right now there is a rumour that Warren Buffet has also entered Tesla post S&P inclusion, worlds biggest value investor is changing his investment basics, we have seen it in Snow as well. 
I guess if GDRX proves that it can co-exist with Amazon pharmacy, GDRX could be another winner
11/19/20, 12:55 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Carvana a company that doesn’t make money ... it’s stock was $250
11/19/20, 12:55 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Many many such examples
11/19/20, 12:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah, I do when I sure of the support levels. 34 vs 37 won't matter if your hold period is years IMO
11/19/20, 12:55 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s just liquidity nothing else
11/19/20, 12:56 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Young people have more risk appetite
11/19/20, 12:56 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Every person on H1 or L1 is investing in market .. that wasn’t the case 20 years back. I certainly didn’t do it.
11/19/20, 12:57 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I am sure even the guys on B1 visa might be investing in us market
11/19/20, 12:57 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I know guys who are investing/trading from India
11/19/20, 12:58 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: No one keeps cash in bank. A portion of paycheck gets diverted to market. And that in turns moves market higher
11/19/20, 12:58 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: That’s just my personal view.
11/19/20, 12:58 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Is it good or bad? I don’t know
11/19/20, 12:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Zoom was growing at 300% and shop at 100%, just can't look at the value, even if they grow one third of that multiples will get down in a couple of years. 

There is typically a premium you pay for quality. Point being I first  got in Shop at $100 and zoom at $65, it was overvalued then and overalvalued today.
11/19/20, 1:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Amazon and Netflix were overvalued through out their life generated life changing wealtg
11/19/20, 1:01 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I call it new girlfriend. Wall Street or traders are looking for a new girlfriend every 6 months. They need new ticker to play around. Fisker by doing nothing jumps 70% in a week!
11/19/20, 1:02 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 😂😂
11/19/20, 1:02 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Zoom and Shop were new girlfriends earlier this year

11/19/20, 1:03 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Have fun guys
11/19/20, 1:03 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Nice talking to you all

11/19/20, 1:11 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Covid has expedited the digitalisation journey for most of the organisations and has forced them to adapt to 10-15 years ahead of time, the market is just the reflection of that, this year might be the start of a new era all together.
11/19/20, 1:13 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It’s good that ppl are investing IMO😁
11/19/20, 1:27 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: What do you guys think about biden capital gain tax increase?
11/19/20, 1:27 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Is it coming in 2021 or getting pushed to 2022?
11/19/20, 1:28 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: If georgia run off goes for democrats, then 50-50 will allow biden admin to push through tax increase.
11/19/20, 1:28 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: How much time will that take?
11/19/20, 1:28 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Is he going to be able to apply it retrospective from 1st Jan?
11/19/20, 1:29 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Any expert opinions?
11/19/20, 1:50 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: For sure it cannot be applied for 2021 tax year. So in worst case could be possible for 2022
11/19/20, 1:50 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Tesla over $500($2500)

11/19/20, 2:12 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Good thing here is the patience. You did not get tempted to sell early and book profit....Good job👏
11/19/20, 2:18 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Patience and luck. Some stocks never return back. IMO exit strategy is really the key for both booking profits and minimizing losses more than entry. Something similar to chakravyuh, ander jaane ka raasta pata hai baahar aane ka nahi

11/19/20, 2:30 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: No expert opinion but I don’t think he can do for 2021. So the worst case scenario is 2022. I am also betting on him not getting 50% senate.
11/19/20, 2:34 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Also on the 9th September it further crashed to 330 post not getting included to S&P, anyone bought then would have made 50% in these 2.5 months.....

11/19/20, 2:35 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: This all comes down to investment stock VS trading stock. I have realized on trading stock to book your target profit (whatever 10-20%) and move on to invest in another stock to get maximum investment turnover... Offcourse few stock will get stuck.

I am upbeat about this stock in long run and I think it is an opportunity to enter at a good price.

Expert opinion welcome.

11/19/20, 3:49 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Well to be honest, as more and more EV companies started emerging, I started looking for companies in charging station space. I found few companies and started following them.

I found chargepoint better positioned than others and in process of going public. Hence I invested in it. 

The information I mentioned is in public space. Just that I was following it for a while.

11/20/20, 12:55 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: None of these Chinese companies are more valuable than Ford or GM! But the market doesn’t think the way I do. So let them enjoy the ride. These are new girlfriends of the market. Kisi din dhokha de kar bhagegi. To me they look like another TLRY in making!
11/20/20, 12:56 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Journey of $300 to $1.5!! I remember the day it hit 300.. it dropped $150 in like 30 minutes.
11/20/20, 12:57 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I don’t invest in any of the Chinese company including BABA!
11/20/20, 1:00 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: By the way if anyone wants to invest in a great company it’s HUM. It was $474 not too long ago. It’s $405 type today

11/20/20, 2:25 PM - Niteen: Anyone tracking AMAT?
11/20/20, 3:20 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: lots of people have been saying the same for Tesla, but it has not... so enjoy the ride. Take a long position when it is going up and take a short position when it is coming down. enjoy both ways just like one does on roller coaster.
11/20/20, 3:30 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Agreed....same thing I was hearing last year Dec and thus year Jan months when Tesla was booming....several analysts were telling this as bubble and now they became bubble. Tesla is way way ahead.
11/20/20, 3:31 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: What happened to those days of right valuations? Tesla story is a story of Bulls. They sell 500k cars a year and their market value is 500bn. 1mn for each car! I don’t think it’s justified but that’s just me.
11/20/20, 3:31 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Tesla investors have been plain lucky! It was a satta jo seedha pad gaya
11/20/20, 3:44 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: the traditional method of valuation does not work any more, specially when the interest rates are near zero. What do you compare with? Very simple - if someone feels a stock is overvalued, market provide a beautiful tool called "short sell", which is available for use. Regarding NIO, my take is - it has got a premium product in a premium market like china where consumers have a very deep pocket to spend on luxury products.

11/20/20, 3:46 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: If you think of Tesla like any other car company then what you say is right.. However, I think tesla is a technology company and they are way ahead of others. Whether it is their software or their batteries, they are ahead of competition.
They might be overvalued but you cannot value that company just on the basis of their car sales.

11/21/20, 9:56 AM - +1 (917) 578-2068: I got it another group
11/21/20, 9:57 AM - +1 (917) 578-2068: Thought few people may be interested
11/21/20, 10:03 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: If only earning money from market was so easy! 🙏🙏🙏
11/21/20, 10:05 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Most people in stock market lose, only few make it on daily basis!
11/21/20, 10:05 AM - +1 (917) 578-2068: I agree 100% with you.
11/21/20, 10:06 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Passive investment strategy works!
11/21/20, 10:07 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Dump and forget
11/21/20, 10:07 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Can’t compete with traders that have big monitors and tools
11/21/20, 10:08 AM - +1 (917) 578-2068: Just to clarify I am no way related to this webinar. Just forwarded as recived. Please use your own judgement.
11/21/20, 10:08 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Most traders do App trading these days and you can only do so much .. do for fun!
11/21/20, 10:08 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I know ..
11/21/20, 10:10 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Trading with 2k or 5k .. if you lose it won’t make a difference in life. One of my friend does it for fun and never trades with more than 1k. If he plays Tesla he will only buy 2 stocks and rinse repeat throughout a day.
11/21/20, 10:11 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: He is the only one I know has made money in stock market.
11/21/20, 10:11 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Consistently
11/21/20, 10:30 AM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Sizing is good. Is there any strategy that helps it work consistency?
11/21/20, 10:31 AM - +1 (551) 232-6566: Study says..  Making money in stock market is one of the easiest thing in the world..  so easy that even dead people does it better than the active trade. Problem is people confuse investing with gambling.
11/21/20, 10:31 AM - +1 (551) 232-6566: https://wealthydiligence.com/best-investors-are-dead/
11/21/20, 10:50 AM - +1 (203) 543-6706: I have been quiet in this group for a while but I guess it's time for me to express my disappointment at some of you. 

Note, we are all equal in here, and I think we really need to respect ourselves and respect each other's privacy!

For this group to stay together, this should be the last time such a thing happens.

We are all friends, colleagues and  mates but there is a limit in just everything and each person's private life must be respected.

Who gave my phone number to Joe Biden? This morning he called me to ask me to attend his swearing in!

Please stop this.
11/21/20, 10:51 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: bhai, gift le kar hi aana 🙏
11/21/20, 11:00 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You will also receive one from Trump, if he gives a concession speech 💬
11/21/20, 11:02 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: He does play with 3x ETFs both on Bulls and Bear side. So it works out for him. When market is down his bear ETFs do well and he sells them out and buys bulls ETF. When market is green he buys bear ETFs and sells out bulls ETFs.
11/21/20, 11:03 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: He makes money both ways!
11/21/20, 11:09 AM - +1 (415) 662-3481: If you can find out what all he looks at for arriving at sell/buy decisions, it may help all here. Successful methodology can be replicated I mean
11/21/20, 11:10 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Sizing is biggest one. The day I alerted VRM here he bought 45 VRM at $33 and sold out at $36
11/21/20, 11:17 AM - +1 (203) 543-6706: Gift chodoo chanda dena padega

11/21/20, 2:11 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: He doesn’t play options. It’s 3x ETFs so you don’t lose money with time.
11/21/20, 2:16 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Any one attended it?
11/21/20, 2:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: As long as one is ok to accept gut wrenching volatility, 3x etf can be part of portfolio to generate above average alpha even for long term investors.
11/21/20, 2:41 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Yes it doesn’t work for me. Somehow he has figured it out. Plus he plays both ways so risk is minimized.
11/21/20, 2:42 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Additional thing is he doesn’t stay beyond a certain gain.
11/21/20, 2:42 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Doesn’t matter if it goes further up
11/21/20, 2:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah, he is trading, I was talking about multi-year investing
11/21/20, 3:08 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Nash is like motley fool( long term investing)

11/23/20, 1:13 AM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Any suggestions for buying yes bank shares in India?
11/23/20, 8:01 AM - +1 (347) 593-3609: In my opinion No for short trade, yes for long trade (next 3years wait period) .... 
yes bank is locked for 3years ..... 
Example if you buy 100 shares today you can sell only 25 share , rest you can't sell on same day ..... 
There is limit on selling your yes bank shares .....
Be planned before you buy shares of yes bank .
11/23/20, 8:06 AM - +1 (972) 754-6465: I had 25k shares with average price of 30 . My shares are locked

11/23/20, 1:43 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Any crypto bulls here, whats the price target for BTC, ETH, XRP long term and which one you prefer most ?
11/23/20, 2:12 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Don't know about the target but BTC can go as high as 200K, as long as govt keeps printing money, BTC will continue to go higher...
11/23/20, 3:30 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Estimates are from $20k to few hundred thousand. No one can tell you the intrinsic value of this, because it doesn't have cash flows and a number of things have to go right in terms of its acceptability as an asset class. What I can tell you is that much more riskier to buy now then when no one was looking at it. 

Alts are still cheaper, so one can take a look but one has to be nimble to sell when the time comes. At the highest level I think 2021 can be bullish for risk assets, so crypto can be a beneficiary.

11/23/20, 5:41 PM - +1 (908) 672-5619: right , we need to be smart enough to come out on slide
11/23/20, 5:41 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Agree
11/23/20, 5:42 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Per MuddyWaters YY doesn’t make moneyb
11/23/20, 5:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: All Chinese stocks can’t command 100s of BN market share
11/23/20, 5:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Practically not possible
11/23/20, 5:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: These are fake companies
11/23/20, 5:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Listed here just to steal American $$
11/23/20, 5:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Look at YY, PDD etc etc
11/23/20, 5:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Look at their market value
11/23/20, 5:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Every company is fake!
11/23/20, 5:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I don’t even trust the numbers of BABA
11/23/20, 6:00 PM - +1 (908) 672-5619: Thanks upkar, we definitely keep your suggestions on our mind while acting .
11/23/20, 6:00 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: That’s my view buddy!
11/23/20, 6:01 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Don’t get distracted because of my view. If you are making money keep milking the sucker
11/23/20, 6:05 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The skepticism of numbers coming from Chinese companies are in part responsible for them to be reasonably valued vs US counterparts. Baba does more sales on singles day, has grown faster than Amazon, is more profitable but half the market cap for Amazon. The Shanghai composite multiples are 30-40% lower than SPX, despite Chinese companies grow a multiple of SPX. While one needs to be careful, totally ignoring Chinese market may take a major source of Alpha from investors portfolio.
11/23/20, 6:09 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: This message was deleted
11/23/20, 6:09 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And since you mentioned PDD, I am seriously considering this internet giant as part of my portfolio from my proceeds from Baba at a reasonable price.
11/23/20, 6:10 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 😂😂
11/23/20, 6:11 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Send me my commission when u make money
11/23/20, 6:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yes sir, I will also be sending my investment thesis suggesting why this may be a good investment for folks to consider.
11/23/20, 6:13 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Ok
11/23/20, 6:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: For starters, I think this article from the one of the best start up investor in the world (who also invest in disruptive public companies) does a good job in providing an overview of social commerce landscape in China and how this can gain traction in other countries

11/23/20, 6:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Shopee is SE (one of my portfolio companies)
11/23/20, 6:25 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It makes sense because they capture grocery market, which are repeat purchase items
11/23/20, 6:25 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I can’t fathom a company to be 70bn when it sells only handful cars
11/23/20, 6:25 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: There is no validity of these numbers
11/23/20, 6:26 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: A company can’t make 100s of BN in revenue in just few years
11/23/20, 6:26 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s just not possible
11/23/20, 6:26 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Like zoom cannot do 2.4 trillion minutes
11/23/20, 6:26 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Too good to be true.
11/23/20, 6:27 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: And it will have 0.4 mn in just few months
11/23/20, 6:28 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Think All Chinese automakers can’t be innovative and can command 50+BN market value
11/23/20, 6:28 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Just by selling few hundred cars
11/23/20, 6:28 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Same thing with these internet companies

11/23/20, 6:28 PM - +1 (202) 640-9499: awesome! what is the source of this chart?
11/23/20, 6:29 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: That’s a word we have heard for many many years
11/23/20, 6:29 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I don't belive in conspiracy theories for a large company that reports to SEC

11/23/20, 6:29 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Why just LK

11/23/20, 6:30 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I can’t fathom NIO a $75bn company
11/23/20, 6:31 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Or XPEV at $50
11/23/20, 6:31 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: NIO will soon be 200BN company
11/23/20, 6:31 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: That's selectivity bias, what would you say about enrollment, worldcom, Bernie madoff of the world
11/23/20, 6:31 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Same goes with PDD YY BABA etx stx
11/23/20, 6:31 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Etc etc

11/23/20, 6:32 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: NIO has a higher potential than Tesla and specially it is operating in a market that needs to go all electric
11/23/20, 6:32 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Why ?
11/23/20, 6:33 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: If it was such a great company why was it languishing at $1 for 2-3 years
11/23/20, 6:33 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: This is just a temp euphoria
11/23/20, 6:33 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It will die down soon
11/23/20, 6:33 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: that is same for tesla, amazon
11/23/20, 6:33 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Amazon fell 90% in the tech crisis
11/23/20, 6:33 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It was garbage
11/23/20, 6:33 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: market takes time to value a company, it does not happen overnight
11/23/20, 6:33 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: In 2018 every weed company was worth billions .. we were going to have weed in our coke

11/23/20, 6:34 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Look at NIO sales they sell handful of cars

11/23/20, 6:36 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I am not a fan of Chinese companies a

11/23/20, 6:36 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: All are govt controlled
11/23/20, 6:36 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: They can say whatever number they want .. we haven’t gone to China to see NIO cars in every corner of the city
11/23/20, 6:36 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: While we do see Tesla
11/23/20, 6:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Home country bias in behavioral finance
11/23/20, 6:37 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Auditors have their hands dirty
11/23/20, 6:37 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: WHO didn’t say anything about corona
11/23/20, 6:38 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: There is a reason Trump was against who .. I am sure they were paid by China

11/23/20, 6:40 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I don’t trust them. I have my hands burnt in Chinese stocks. Both ways .. short vs long. I don’t intend to suggest it to anyone.
11/23/20, 6:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: E&Y, big 4 auditor for PDD, they have seperate audit committee who provides oversight to their reporting.
11/23/20, 6:44 PM - +1 (310) 748-7761: Any news? Or start of Biden transition will lift these?
11/23/20, 6:45 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: They all are dirty when it comes to Chinese market. Can’t trust them.
11/23/20, 6:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Unfortunately this is your opinion/belief, so I would this matter to rest.
11/23/20, 6:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: put
11/23/20, 7:00 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Me too - though i strongly believe in chinese innovative companies and feel they will lead the next bull market. Investment is a personal choice and should only invest if one is convinced.
11/23/20, 7:01 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Innovation? China?
11/23/20, 7:02 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Where do you see $1. It was listed in Nasdaq in 2018 and was $20 at that time. Totally reasonable for them to grow 6x given the acceleration from Covid.
11/23/20, 7:02 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: To me they are copy cats and by not allowing American companies, make their own FB and Google. They are good at copying and at a faster pace 😂
11/23/20, 7:04 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: NIO has BaaS, isn’t that innovation ?
11/23/20, 7:04 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: It’s a copy from Tesla.
11/23/20, 7:05 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Tesla hasn’t introduced yet but they have all the background work in progress for a while.
11/23/20, 7:06 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: There was a hacker who hacked Tesla app and figured out the BaaS plans.
11/23/20, 7:08 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: And more over, SaaS has been there for a while. Even razors are being delivered as subscription 😂. And you call it innovation 👍🏻
11/23/20, 7:09 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: BaaS reduces the upfront cost for a consumer, leading to faster adoption.
11/23/20, 7:09 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There is portion of digital China which is significantly more advanced in AI, fintech, AR/VR, robotics than US
11/23/20, 7:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: China is not the same that it was 20 yrs ago
11/23/20, 7:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They are competing to be the technology leader of the world
11/23/20, 7:11 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: I agree and I have experienced it first hand on the ground in China
11/23/20, 7:11 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: However, no point discussing this, I would invest because I believe in it. There are million other investment choices for those who don't believe in it...
11/23/20, 7:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍👆
11/23/20, 8:13 PM - +1 (917) 375-1299: Most Chinese companies numbers  are manipulated, and they don't have independent body of auditors.
They create numbers which they want to show to outside world.
11/23/20, 8:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Thats your opinion. You have no basis and cannot prove it.
11/23/20, 8:20 PM - +1 (917) 375-1299: Yes, I agree with you.
11/23/20, 8:33 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Good conversation.. what about the weed stock? Is it gonna go up tomorrow?
11/23/20, 8:34 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: ACB mein enter kiya ja sakta hai kya?
11/23/20, 8:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I have so far avoided cannabis stock, but now there is a case of becoming it mainstream given Biden presidency as I had listed here and because most of them have fallen significantly.

Given the risk to individual stock names, I had entered a speculative position in YOLO, which is one of the best etf in this sector at slightly over $12.5/unit
11/23/20, 8:43 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: YOLO, will take a look .. thanks
11/23/20, 8:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Up 17%, since my level but the all time high will still generate close to 100% return.
11/23/20, 8:46 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its a swing trade for me, rather than long term buy and hold. As long as technicals are favorable, I will ride it.
11/23/20, 9:41 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Got It Nash .. Thank You
11/23/20, 10:02 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Were you talking about YOLO.. I see YOLO is @14.70 and 52 week high is 15.16
11/23/20, 10:11 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Even their currency is manipulated 😄. And it’s open. They can reduce the value or increase at the xi’s will.
11/23/20, 10:12 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Eggaxtly! Currency fluctuate karke $$ revenue beat kar lo .. kya farak padta hai ..
11/23/20, 10:12 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Coty crossed $7
11/23/20, 10:13 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Highly manipulated state media followed by manipulated companies
11/23/20, 10:16 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: These dems are to open cannabis for personal use. You can start slowly investing in GRWG, CWBHF and other budding / beaten down stocks.
11/23/20, 10:16 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: NJ voted to legalize cannabis, though I voted not to 😟😞
11/23/20, 10:24 PM - +1 (646) 413-2283: True if Indians need to diversify outside USA then they can always invest in indian companies. Indian index is also at all time high right now.
11/23/20, 10:38 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: What will be that reasonable price? I have few stocks. When to exit?
11/23/20, 10:56 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: <Media omitted>
11/23/20, 10:57 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I have it 🙂.

11/24/20, 7:08 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Most of them are fundamentally good companies. Its good they are not invested in ACB, tilrays of the world that fell from few hundred dollars to under $10
11/24/20, 7:09 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I own IIPR on my personal long term portfolio at $80
11/24/20, 7:11 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I will be adding for long term, so I am looking this to be a multibagger
11/24/20, 7:15 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I dont think currency has to do anything with revenue beat. They beat in local currency too.
11/24/20, 7:20 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I meant to ask exit price for BABA. That you will sell to add PDD
11/24/20, 7:22 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: <Media omitted>
11/24/20, 7:23 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I entered last week. Just 100 shares each though.
11/24/20, 7:24 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I cannot help if you hate Chinese people and companies. I understand that the state has an agenda, but doesnt make their people at fault. They are equally or more industrious that you and me, and who in turn run these companies. Rather than barraging them on unfounded claims, lets talk facts and provide research on the companies that we discuss here (good or bad). It will be more productive for everyone.
11/24/20, 7:32 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Penny stocks move up and they move down. Just because price is going up for a day, doesn't make them good mid to long term stocks. For eg, Tilray increased sales by $150 M over the last couple of years, but increased their losses by $300Mm.
11/24/20, 7:35 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Again, for trading its all good, and may be the current environment help them to generate 100's of percent of return, but I cannot do day /short term trading, so I avoid stocks that are not fundamentally sound.
11/24/20, 7:38 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I have already sold it to create way for other companies.
11/24/20, 8:43 AM - +1 (425) 306-3642: Any lead on IPWR?
11/24/20, 9:34 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: why all EVs are going down
11/24/20, 9:35 AM - +1 (908) 672-5619: Idex, fcel what these
11/24/20, 9:35 AM - +1 (408) 396-9658: Kisiki nazar lag geya
11/24/20, 9:35 AM - +1 (908) 672-5619: Fcel yesterday was around 4
11/24/20, 9:36 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bubble is over

11/24/20, 9:55 AM - +1 (609) 216-4502: is there any listed EV stock that hasnt jumped in last couple of days. :)
11/24/20, 10:20 AM - +1 (860) 839-6893: Apple is falling down , do any one know why?
11/24/20, 10:20 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s falling because of gravity
11/24/20, 10:21 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Jokes apart money rotation

When Ark invest gave a target of $4000-7000, whole of wall street laughed at Cathy Woods, the stock seems to moving as per her prediction, by the time it starts trading in S&P 500 Index in Dec, It could be very well at higher 600s or lower 700s.

11/24/20, 5:01 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: And the two employees probably are :   Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig. Their combined experience includes more than 100 technology IPOs and mergers involving companies such as Microsoft, Oracle and Twilio.
11/24/20, 5:01 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: There has to be something amazing for sure.

11/24/20, 9:11 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: 🤦🏻‍♂️ kya yar....1 din baad aa jata news to kya jata iska
11/24/20, 10:07 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Keep an eye on INAQ (SPAC) who is acquiring Metromile, a leader in pay per mile auto insurance company. The SPAC began trading today. Here are the highlights 

- The company utilizes data science to provide one of the cheapest auto insurance in the country. It provides a dongle attached to your car, and tracks driving habits. Unlike other insurance companies, pricing is not fixed, a majority of customer save and since they track driving habits, loss related to claim reduces over time. 

- 76% annual premium growth over last 5 years. 

- Best in class loss rate, customer life time value and claim processing. App store rating of 4.7. Average customer stay for 3.5 yrs. I am a customer for 5 yrs. 

- Currently in 8 states, plan to reach 20+ state in 2021 and then the whole nation in 5 years. 

- Multiple optionality to disrupt other markets (Home insurance, pet insurance etc) 

- $100Mm in revenue which they projected to grow to $1bn over the next 5 yrs (take with grain of salt). They will be profitable in a few years. 

- Mark Cuban is an existing investor. Billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitya is investing 160Mm in 1.2bn deal. 

Negative - Revenue will be flat in 2020 because of covid (as their revenue increases when people drive more). However this is a play for reopening of the economy. Currently slightly over $11 (up 14% today).
11/24/20, 10:09 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: This seems like a good company! I could actually buy insurance from them.
11/24/20, 10:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I know that you like insurance companies. This will deliver large cash flows for long term investors 🙂
11/24/20, 10:12 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: 😀
11/24/20, 10:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I consider Chamath as one of the smartest investor in our business. Obviously he will be getting sweet deal, nonetheless good opportunity in my view
11/24/20, 10:13 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: metromile is a good concept
11/24/20, 10:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Do you use buddy?
11/24/20, 10:13 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Are end customers open to share their driving details yet, I know of few friends who would just turn of the data when they have to drive rash and turn it back on when they are ready to drive sane . 
How would this impact their insurance premium. Adaptability is where investors would have concern, if you have some insight around it please share.
11/24/20, 10:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am a law abiding driver and will not be able to comment. They will lose though if people choose to cheat. You get mails though if your car is inactive for a few days and they will cancel your insurance
11/24/20, 10:18 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: i have used it in the past kept it for almost a year and then switched because was driving lot of miles. for someone who drives less, this might be good savings.
11/24/20, 10:19 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I like this concept and myself got a 25% discount to subscribe the insurance app from my current insurance provider. But not everyone likes to subscribe to this as then they have to drive very carefully, no sudden brakes, cornering has to be smooth etc, hence wanted to check if you have some data around adoptability for this.
11/24/20, 10:20 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: These apps makes roads lot safer but not everyone wants to be drive safely , that’s the problem
11/24/20, 10:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Their estimate is 65% of the population would save switching to their insurance. Another factor is the data science which tracks customer habbit and help minimize loss over time.
11/24/20, 10:20 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: good one...will definitely watch.
11/24/20, 10:20 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: metromile doesnt base it on driving style, the tracker is for miles driven only unless they came with some other product.
11/24/20, 10:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I think they record everything
11/24/20, 10:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Which is why the concept
11/24/20, 10:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: That's what they say
11/24/20, 10:22 PM - +1 (631) 429-6726: Great insight! Thanks!
11/24/20, 10:23 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Ya I think so too, as my app used to record everything, and in order to get the 25% discount I had to drive very cautiously, even while merging onto highways I had to accelerate very smoothly.
11/24/20, 10:23 PM - +1 (201) 755-0082: No, they give 2 options. If you plugin to your car then everything. But you can just keep it thru usb charger in which case just GPS based miles
11/24/20, 10:23 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep
11/24/20, 10:24 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: no additional discount based on driving style though even if they record
11/24/20, 10:24 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Then discounts would be lesser in comparison to recording everything as the benefit of AI kicks in only when they record the driving habits and not only the miles
11/24/20, 10:27 PM - +1 (201) 755-0082: Interesting will check with customer care if there is any discount based on that 👍
11/24/20, 10:27 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: <Media omitted>
11/24/20, 10:28 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Hence adoption is pretty low for this .... not everyone wants to be traced you know😜😜
11/24/20, 10:29 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: I am following another company that Chamath is investing in..
MP - looks good for long term investors. I don’t have position yet but might take soon.
11/24/20, 10:29 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: What is it about?
11/24/20, 10:31 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: It is the largest rare earth supply outside China
11/24/20, 10:31 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: With EV boom, they might be key Lithium suppliers
11/24/20, 10:32 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: <Media omitted>
11/24/20, 10:33 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: from Twitter
11/24/20, 10:33 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Elon said there is enough lithium in Nevada itself , is this about extreme long term ?
11/24/20, 10:35 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Even though there is Lithium, mining, extracting and supply chain needs expertise that this company has. It looks to be an upcoming force to me.. still following as it started trading on 18th of this month itself.
11/24/20, 10:36 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: <Media omitted>
11/24/20, 10:37 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Got it, thanks!
11/24/20, 10:38 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I guess the qualitative section mentions that it does record driving habits
11/24/20, 10:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I will have to review this. I avoid early stage companies, otherwise there is a lot of activity in SPAC these days.
11/24/20, 10:41 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It’s already 20% up, EV is selling like hot cake these days !
11/24/20, 10:42 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Good, but I will not be investing just because its going up. Can someone review this and provide details on their numbers?
11/24/20, 10:43 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Did not know about this. And I am very impressed. I am entering tomorrow with a small position.
11/24/20, 10:44 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: True, I also avoid them but SBE and MP are strongly getting my attention. Also, these companies seem to address genuine problems. Hence finding them attractive.
11/24/20, 10:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍
11/24/20, 10:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I would not say low adoption given the growth they seen over the last few years. People gave up privacy and made Facebook what its today. Will people be happy to share driving details. I'd think so if its adequately priced and have an excellent claim processing unit.
11/24/20, 10:53 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Did u remember movie pass?😂
11/24/20, 10:54 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I was not a subscriber. Is there a similarity?
11/24/20, 10:56 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: people started cheating, the company couldn't control, and finally they had to close the shop
11/24/20, 10:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Hmm
11/24/20, 10:56 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: U said about cheat. So i was comparing with movie pass(people cheated. Company filed bankruptcy)
11/24/20, 10:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Point to note. The risk is their claim would not process, if they cheat and drive and the dongle cannot track it.
11/24/20, 10:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: During an accident
11/24/20, 10:59 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: But there wasn’t any AI or strict data collection for movie pass they used to believe what was written on the form, driving is different, the habits get recorded, do you use adaptive cruise control, drivers assist etc. I think it’s different then movie pass
11/24/20, 11:00 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: about 8-9 years ago, I had Progressive car insurance. They also had similar device that I plugin the car. I liked the idea, that I will be more careful while driving. But that never translated into cost savings to me. So I switched to Geico few years back.
11/24/20, 11:01 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Only thing is the adoption rate, if they  are able to get enough subscribers these apps are really safe and more users subscribes to it the roads become more safer
11/24/20, 11:02 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: The company went bankrupt around 2018 if I remember correctly, not long ago. There was AI at that time. But there are too many loopholes. 
Yes driving is different. If the AI can improve the efficiency and pass on the saving to the customers, yes this is a winner
11/24/20, 11:03 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: And as they will have the data analysis they can charge different amount to different customers basically extending the commercial benefits to more safe and disciplined drivers post driving habits analysis
11/24/20, 11:03 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: My Statefarm is already collecting this information even though I pay monthly insurance.
11/24/20, 11:04 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: After all, technology is there to reduce costs or achieve greater amounts of tasks within less time (efficiency). If it doesn't help with these 2, its on the way to be doomed.
11/24/20, 11:04 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Like my insurance company extended me 25% discount over previous year post analysing my driving habits, I dint even shop outside.....
11/24/20, 11:04 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It would be great if you are billed purely based on miles
11/24/20, 11:05 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Lemonade is coming up with similar concept. Need to wait and see.
11/24/20, 11:05 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I was careful initially now I don’t give a damn about the app!
11/24/20, 11:05 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Miles can be just one of the parameters
11/24/20, 11:06 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Because you did not receive 25%?
11/24/20, 11:07 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Rt because you are not getting benefitted but if your company says they will extend you 30-40% discount if you always drive under speed limits I guess you will start giving it some attention
11/24/20, 11:07 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s too much! You lose the fun of driving. It’s all about giving up control.
11/24/20, 11:07 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: At the highest level, I think this industry is fragmented and pricing is poor from legacy providers. This market is ripe for disruption and someone will do it. I also think that more than a few companies can thrive taking market share for existing providers in years to come.
11/24/20, 11:07 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Again, all will be seen in due course
11/24/20, 11:07 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: True. They were offering chillar!
11/24/20, 11:08 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Gotta go, good night
11/24/20, 11:08 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Like $30 in 6 months
11/24/20, 11:08 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: @Nash- this is what I wanted to highlight, not everyone can give up the driving fun and get restricted by the app, hence adoptability is critical for this business
11/24/20, 11:09 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I called them during covid and asked for massive discount as cars were parked in garage .. didn’t get a good response.
11/24/20, 11:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I drive sports mode from time to time, never penalized with higher rates. 

Even if they do, as long as your premium is better then the next provider, they should be able to win market share.
11/24/20, 11:30 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It’s a very good concept and more people drive with these apps, more safer would be the roads for sure, as their terms and conditions are stringent and sometimes difficult to abide with them, would be interesting to see how soon they capture the market and their numbers
11/24/20, 11:31 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Accordingly we can invest
11/25/20, 7:11 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: NiO 4.7 percent down pre market

Nio is still up significantly for me, if it crashes further and goes to lower than my buying price, will add more else I am good and still hopeful for the future of this business
11/25/20, 7:51 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I would have locked profit yesterday morning and ready to enter again.
11/25/20, 7:51 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: But again that’s just me
11/25/20, 8:06 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Would have done the same if new the future 😁😁
11/25/20, 8:07 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: May I know your average price? Share if you are okay.
11/25/20, 8:07 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 42
11/25/20, 8:08 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Ok
11/25/20, 8:09 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Good luck to you buddy!

11/25/20, 10:37 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Looks like , lot of selling on chinese EV, and american EV fsr is gaining , 18 percent up today
11/25/20, 10:51 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Same here. For me even today XPEV is up 80% and NIO 20%. Will buy more if XPEV ever comes below 50 and NIO below 44.
11/25/20, 10:51 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍👍
11/25/20, 10:52 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I sold all my Nio at 52 which I had bought under $10 2 years ago
Will buy again if it goes under $40. It might.
11/25/20, 10:52 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Yes If you can time the market. First of all you would not have entered in any of Chinese stock to start with 🙂
11/25/20, 10:53 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: And Xpev under $30
11/25/20, 11:02 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Google removes Baidu apps after they were found collecting sensitive user data - South China Morning Post

11/25/20, 11:08 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: SPCE 🚀 👽 👾
11/25/20, 11:09 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: do you have stocks ?
11/25/20, 11:16 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Yup
11/25/20, 11:26 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Cloudflare almost $70
11/25/20, 11:29 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍 Do you own it?
11/25/20, 11:30 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Yes got it at $42 and held it even when it was down to $33.
11/25/20, 11:31 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Didn't add more though
11/25/20, 11:37 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👌 multibagger in the making
11/25/20, 11:37 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Agree
11/25/20, 11:38 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Do you have a price range in mind over the next few months/ years?
11/25/20, 11:41 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: *SALESFORCE HAS HELD TALKS TO BUY SLACK TECHNOLOGIES: DJ  $CRM $WORK

$WORK now halted
11/25/20, 11:50 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Wow, WORK is up 20% already
11/25/20, 11:51 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: This makes sense. Salesforce has in built feature called Chatter which users don't really use and they use slack instead.
11/25/20, 11:58 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Nope, its a long term pick, so timing the market/picking up price is useless as long as the business performs.
11/25/20, 12:01 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Yes. I'm going to ride this long.
11/25/20, 12:04 PM - Niteen: What's your take on SQ?
11/25/20, 12:05 PM - Niteen: Anyone tracking PLTR? It's moving fast..
11/25/20, 12:07 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: SQ also excellent in long term IMO. I got a very small position at 138. Regret not getting more.
11/25/20, 12:08 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I am invested in it since June, it is my second largest position after Tesla.
It is going to disrupt the banks in long run, very dip I have added more to it and happy with the returns so far.
Funny thing is stick falls very fast and recovers very fast too😁
11/25/20, 12:11 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: In October I added few for 140, two weeks back I added some for 155.... and today it’s 200+ explains it’s volatility but if you can hang in there, it will give you return in long turn
11/25/20, 12:11 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Anyone keeping eyes on Freddie mac and Fannie mae? They risen about 40% in the last week on speculation they might come out of govt control. If that happens they will explode up.
11/25/20, 12:14 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: 👍
11/25/20, 12:15 PM - Niteen: Thanks for sharing 👍
11/25/20, 12:16 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Meanwhile TSLA crawling to $600
11/25/20, 12:16 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Looks like Chamath is on a roll. Hes a big investor in Slack. Lets consider INAQ 😜
11/25/20, 12:17 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: And MP too😜
11/25/20, 12:20 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Its a very speculative position. Service is only for millionaires. But they might get into the international flights with reduced travel times if concept works out. Too risky sector though
11/25/20, 12:21 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: All the stocks are gaining except TDOC, god knows when will it rally.
11/25/20, 12:22 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Fvrr is going really good, I entered at 157 two weeks back and it’s 204 today
11/25/20, 12:22 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Sab aayega vaapas its a patience game for long term unless something wrong with company. Slack i remember has been dead for almost months now and look today. Still learning though :)
11/25/20, 12:23 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yepp patience is the name of the game 👍
11/25/20, 12:27 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Someone here asked about my focus on tech stocks and should diversification be a factor? Some other folks asked about moving away from tech stocks to trades that benefit from reopening of the economy. 

My answer to the above is Tech is undergoing a period of consolidation (which may last for sometime and may lead it to underperform in the near term) but over the long term, this sector is forming a bullish flag and will crush other sectors. At the end of the bull market we might see a melt-up (like the one that was seen in 2000 tech bubble) and there is a reasonable probability that Nasdaq reaches much higher levels (penciling in close to 20k for now, but will change with time). That will lead our stocks to massively outperform over this period. 

That said, I am also cognizant of the fact  that there may be interesting trades in other sector that we should not miss. Since I don't have time to do day trades, I will keep an eye on other interesting stocks in other sectors that are breaking out. Those will not be high conviction ideas (long term), but good enough to make 20-50-100% return. 

We discussed following stocks till date in other sectors (some may be swing trade, some may be long term) 

Yolo - Favorable regulation towards Marijuana companies in Biden presidency 

INAQ - Disruptive insurance company that will challenge legacy providers (and will benefit from reopening)

New one is Draftking which i got in at $46, but will benefit from opening of live sports. 

Watchlist - Enphase energy (one of the best solar companies in the nation), will be beneficial from Biden presidency. This can be a long term pick. I own Solar edge at $100 (competitor of Enphase, but this one is better) 

Couple of more to come, so keep an eye on this thread.
11/25/20, 12:36 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: 20% YOY returns for the next 10-15 years on portfolio we would be millionaires Nash. Thanks for sharing all your insights
11/25/20, 12:37 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks for the info  Nash, did you enter INAQ, it has gone up 16%+ today
11/25/20, 12:37 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: If I was you, I would sell out now.
11/25/20, 12:37 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It has hit the limit
11/25/20, 12:38 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: May I ask why do you suggest everyone to sell the stock when people are making good returns just holding them for long term
11/25/20, 12:38 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I only suggest for Chinese
11/25/20, 12:39 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: If I was you I would not trash Chinese EVs just because you didn't make money😆
11/25/20, 12:39 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Lol.. jokes aside..
11/25/20, 12:39 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I am happy for you.
11/25/20, 12:39 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: What are you not optimistic about cloudflare
11/25/20, 12:39 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Why*
11/25/20, 12:39 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Cloud is not a Chinese company
11/25/20, 12:41 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Here is my 2 cents on NIO. Everyone is looking for next tesla and there is FOMO in the market but NIO is no Tesla. By the way I did make $275 in NIO for quick gain today.
11/25/20, 12:42 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: But I wouldn’t keep it my portfolio
11/25/20, 12:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: But that’s just me
11/25/20, 12:43 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: I thought touching Chinese stocks is against your ethics ? 😀
11/25/20, 12:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I can’t say no to money 😂😂😂
11/25/20, 12:44 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: For most of us invested in Chinese stocks, our exposure would not be more than 2-3%, hence no one is bothered about what it does in short run, however, if any stock explodes in long run, that’s what we are interested in.
11/25/20, 12:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s not ethics
11/25/20, 12:45 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Have fun guys
11/25/20, 12:45 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Enjoy

11/25/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: Happy thanksgiving
11/25/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: That’s the problem of WhatsApp and facebooks of the world
11/25/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I meant Chinese EV stocks
11/25/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You can’t judge anyone by words
11/25/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It could be sarcasm too
11/25/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 😂😂😂
11/25/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Anyway have fun
11/25/20, 12:47 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: Not judging you bro 😊 you played with Chinese EV only 😂
11/25/20, 12:48 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: Resting here
11/25/20, 12:48 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: “mujh par ek ehsaan karana ki mujh par koi ehsaan mat karna” replace ehsaan with upkar 😜

11/25/20, 1:10 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: But INAQ is going to acquire it and INAQ is already public, is Metromile going public separately
11/25/20, 1:12 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: The two are merging and will be known as MLE. INAQ is a SPAC
11/25/20, 1:12 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I'm reading more now

11/25/20, 1:31 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Can you trade on your wife’s name?
11/25/20, 1:31 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Does that require approval?
11/25/20, 1:31 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Yeah, recently they made a change, I could do that

11/25/20, 1:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Very small position at 12.5. The deal is getting done at $10, so I dont like to pay a big premium. Will accumulate up retracement.
11/25/20, 1:54 PM - +1 (224) 422-2950: It’s too late to get in now ?
11/25/20, 1:54 PM - +1 (224) 422-2950: $14
11/25/20, 1:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There is an initial hype, under most cases, they die after few days/weeks, so I will buy then. The merger is not complete, there is no need to rush.
11/25/20, 1:57 PM - +1 (224) 422-2950: Thanks that’s what I thought.
11/25/20, 1:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Again, I dont know how high this can go, so its a choice.

11/25/20, 6:52 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Yes Cramer thinks it’s 100
11/25/20, 6:52 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I will buy at $40 when it drops
11/25/20, 6:53 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Uske pahale nahi
11/25/20, 6:53 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I did not want to buy a lot today as it was falling.
11/25/20, 6:53 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: He is doing some work for them as well.
11/25/20, 6:55 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Then u just missed it. I had some already that went to 62 and came down in 30s just a month ago. It’s up in 50s today. I added some more at 42.

11/26/20, 2:09 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: NIO is $150 stock in the near term.
11/26/20, 2:15 PM - +1 (419) 215-2329: Buying a Tesla car is not a Investment. May be it is just for fun 😜
11/26/20, 2:16 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I bought tesla stock, made money, and bought tesla car.
11/26/20, 2:16 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Tesla cars are most fun cars to drive.
11/26/20, 2:16 PM - +1 (419) 215-2329: This is Awesome 👌
11/26/20, 2:19 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: I bought Tesla and understood the worth and bought the stocks to made money 😃
11/26/20, 2:22 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: Perfect Plan👌👌👌
11/26/20, 2:33 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Probably even higher. Imagine if NIO’s battery standard is adopted by few other ev makers, that will give such a boost to the NIO’s innovation...
11/26/20, 2:34 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: unlikely we will have standardized battery packs.
11/26/20, 2:35 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: tech is evolving too fast for anyting much to get standardized
11/26/20, 2:36 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Lots of tech works on a common standards, a great example is USB.
11/26/20, 2:37 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: 🙂 USB is not battery tech; battery tech is 1000x more complicated than USB
11/26/20, 2:37 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Which is why the one standardizing will be the winner
11/26/20, 2:38 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Betterplace was huge tech unicorn in 2010-2012 era, who pioneered swapable battery tech
11/26/20, 2:38 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: https://qz.com/88871/better-place-shai-agassi-swappable-electric-car-batteries/
11/26/20, 2:38 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: They got crushed,, tesla survived.
11/26/20, 2:39 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Betterplace wasted lot of resourcing becoming standardized battery tech, while Tesla just focused on making better cars
11/26/20, 2:39 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: nio seem to be doing both
11/26/20, 2:40 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Or neither,, they are just selling stories
11/26/20, 2:40 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: they dont even have manufacturing line
11/26/20, 2:40 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I personally believe NIO is just a FOMO play of Tesla. People who missed out are betting big on NIO.?
11/26/20, 2:41 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Ok
11/26/20, 2:42 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: China doesn’t even have auto technology ., they are stealing from others just like they stole High Speed Train technology from Japan
11/26/20, 2:42 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I don’t even know a Chinese car brand
11/26/20, 2:42 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Haven’t even heard one
11/26/20, 2:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: We have heard Toyota, Honda, even Hyndai from Korea but any Chinese car maker?
11/26/20, 2:43 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: NIO is credible company, but good investors. But valuation is too expensive, NIO has lot to prove.
11/26/20, 2:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: And suddenly they are going to be market leader in Electric cars??
11/26/20, 2:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s another Luckin Coffee to me!
11/26/20, 2:44 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: with good investors in it.
11/26/20, 2:44 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Possible.
11/26/20, 2:45 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s good to be bullish on a particular stock but thinking they will rule the world is a fallacy!
11/26/20, 2:45 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: yes, Tesla is far ahead of NIO,, like really really far away
11/26/20, 2:46 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: As an investor one needs to focus on creating wealth, does not matter where it comes from.
11/26/20, 2:46 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: both in terms of sales and technology
11/26/20, 2:46 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I personally wouldn’t want to get my battery pack changed every time I want to get on a road. I would rather have my car charged while parked in my garage and ready to go in the morning
11/26/20, 2:46 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: That’s different mindset. Nothing wrong with it! It’s actually best mindset
11/26/20, 2:47 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Again Chinese are not that smart to be world leader in Automobiles when they had no technical expertise to begin with!
11/26/20, 2:48 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Without stealing they can’t survive

11/26/20, 5:17 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I'm not a fan of Chinese car companies or anything chinese. Just clearing some misconceptions.

11/27/20, 10:18 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍...with the release of new FSD software version, full autonomy seems just steps away now, TSLA is sure to rule the auto industry for years to come, a lot of that growth is already priced in today’s stock(might trade near 700 arnd 21 Dec) but still could be a winner for long term.

11/27/20, 11:34 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: What’s the projection for MARA?
11/27/20, 11:41 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: MARA goes with cyrptocurrency....since that is down and so this is....so play wisely.
11/27/20, 11:42 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: for long term, anything below 3 is accumulation zone

above 5-7 is profit taking
11/27/20, 11:44 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Thank you 🙏🏽
11/27/20, 11:46 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: I don’t think BLNK good long term prospect. They have very little market share. Almost no R&D and nothing to warrant any confidence in their business. Charge point has 73% market share in that space and a better company to invest in, if you want to enter this domain.

11/27/20, 3:08 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Is not this a more reason to take position OR I missing your point? I am invested in TLRY and ACB stock and YOLO option. And planning to add some position in Charlotte web on Monday....
11/27/20, 3:23 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Any views on planet 13 stock, last summers I went to Vegas for a conference and happened to visit this place with few friends. It was crowded like hell and we were asked to come back in an hour which we dint, ppl around looked happily stoned😜😜 though, not sure of their business rt now but the stock has gained significantly during this pandemic.
But if these guys scale up with their stores in major tourist destinations across US(post legalisation), this could be big and might be the right time to invest too.
11/27/20, 3:46 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: No idea but seems interesting. Q3 has been outstanding and they are doing so many things to grow. But I can not estimate their scalability capabilities. Does not harm to take a small position. Cannabis is working so ride the wave.
11/27/20, 3:48 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yepp, will enter it, watching it grow from $3 couple of months back, should have entered back then
11/27/20, 3:49 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Ditto. Monday.
11/27/20, 3:49 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍
11/27/20, 3:50 PM - +1 (972) 989-0421: Telegram is a good option.
11/27/20, 3:53 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Ticker ?
11/27/20, 3:54 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Plth
11/27/20, 3:54 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: PLTH?
11/27/20, 3:55 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: And plnhf
11/27/20, 3:55 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It trades in Canada and US with different tickers
11/27/20, 3:55 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: It’s in OTC market
11/27/20, 3:56 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: What is OTC?
11/27/20, 3:57 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Are they not safe to trade?
11/27/20, 3:58 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/over-the-countermarket.asp
11/27/20, 3:58 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: <Media omitted>
11/27/20, 3:59 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: RH did not support OTC
11/27/20, 3:59 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Ok
11/27/20, 4:01 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: In general, OTC markets are typically less transparent than exchanges and are also subject to fewer regulations. Because of this liquidity in the OTC market may come at a premium.
11/27/20, 4:04 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Is it something I should bother before I invest, actually my RBC direct investing allows me to trade in this stock not sure if it is safe after reading your above comments.
11/27/20, 4:07 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Safe or unsafe - I don’t know..

But it not regulated market and normally penny stock trade there as NASDAQ have $1 minimum price to hold.

Every quarter result must for company also for NASDAQ and did not follow by OTC company.

So it may be go to $10 or go to penny stock.
11/27/20, 4:09 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Not regulated means (as I know) - May there reported data be wrong also... (anyone please correct me, if I am wrong)
11/27/20, 4:11 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks for sharing, wasn’t aware of this.
11/27/20, 4:11 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Less volume, less regulated but no harm in using the platform for investing.
11/27/20, 4:12 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: As long as you have trust in your investment. I will still go for a small position on Monday🙂.
11/27/20, 4:28 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Yup
11/27/20, 4:29 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yaa, I did find the concept interesting, no harm in making a small position
11/27/20, 4:29 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Company deal in weeds and next week is hype for weed. I will try this for hype ride for 1 week.
11/27/20, 4:35 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 1 week ride!!! Haha. This is how the stocks are being treated now a days...Specially weed, EV, and related industries.
11/27/20, 4:37 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Enjoy news uncertainty and sell on news 😜😜😜 ... less greedy
11/27/20, 4:43 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: A news popped up and disappeared on my screen (WSJ)... United airlines has been booked for charter planes to carry vaccine if approved...So many good news here -1)- Good for United. Shares may go up Monday, 2-) good for airline industry 3)- and good news for the overall market.
11/27/20, 4:44 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Most of the travel has gone up reasonably high except cruise line....I see an opportunity there. Invest now and you may see a good return within next 6-9 months.
11/27/20, 5:16 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: It is indeed interesting, they have plans of coming up with another prime location near disneyland in LA. They did pretty ok during pandemic which was unexpected. But they have a lot to prove to maintain the same pace . Highly speculative position
11/27/20, 5:17 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Yolo 👍
11/27/20, 6:18 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: @12015655130 I just noticed that you took DKNG...Finally 🙂. So is this a long term position? I have a lot (as you know) and considering offloading some in 60s.
11/27/20, 6:19 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: But may change my decision based on your view.
11/27/20, 6:21 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Is it a buy at current level?
11/27/20, 6:21 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: $50 or so?
11/27/20, 6:33 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: That’s a tough question but I am long on this. They have given a descent growth even during pandemic. Once sports opens it will run... Michael Jordan is an equity holder...Jim Cramer is an advisor for some of their project, George Soros is one of the major investor...still not all of the states have legalized online sports betting. The stock will keep going up as and when they keep adding another stock...This industry is supposed to be 30bn (and so) industry in a decade. And DKNG is poised to be the industry leader....So long story short I don’t know if there will be pull back at this price and you should wait. But in my view even if it comes down but then will go up again.
11/27/20, 6:38 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Typo...keep adding another state (not stock)
11/27/20, 6:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep, not decided if this will be a long term position. I may sell if it retraces after reaching 65-70. Pretty confident that it will reach there (if the broader market remains supportive)
11/27/20, 6:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not sell all, sell some
11/27/20, 7:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah, they are in a pretty sweet spot 👍

11/27/20, 7:08 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I had so many of them at $33
11/27/20, 7:08 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Sold out too soon!
11/28/20, 9:42 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: It’s still at $45. 52 week high is $93. Airline will be slowest to get to the full recovery but I see 30-50% return from here by June.

QUOTE, ”Diess may be right about carmakers becoming the most valuable companies. It’s inevitable, however, that some won't make it.” UNQUOTE. ❤️ so who are the ones that will not make it....Your views plz!!!
11/28/20, 11:06 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Good for QS. 👌🏻
11/28/20, 11:49 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: This also gives a good idea about CIIC..It’s a SPAC being merged with ARRIVAL GRP and will be traded on NASDAQ...CIIC is not super overvalued like other EVs and ARRIVAL has 1.2Bn in orders already including 10k vans from UPS... Worth investing...I am planning to take some stake on Monday.

11/29/20, 9:46 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Because they don’t provide a link to refer people

11/29/20, 11:07 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Lot of people use etrade and TD. I wonder how many use Schwab. They are as good as any other. And trades are free of commissions!
11/29/20, 11:33 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thanks.
11/29/20, 11:36 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: ETrade too has free trade for equity. But you have to pay for option.
11/29/20, 11:42 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Same for TDA. Moreover I find their thinkorswim platform is best in class.

11/30/20, 12:19 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Can you please share link?
11/30/20, 12:19 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: TD Ameritrade does not have link to share
11/30/20, 12:20 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Which is better of tda fidelity and etrade
11/30/20, 12:21 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Personally I have not used fidelity so I cannot give an option on that but both E*TRADE and TD Ameritrade are solid options
11/30/20, 12:21 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: IMO TD Ameritrade has many tools available to use and many educational videos
11/30/20, 12:23 PM - +1 (551) 580-3181: Should we pause the investment into this? any suggestions ?
11/30/20, 12:26 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: That’s what I also was wondering... with all Eva going up without much basis, what’s the take on nikola.. especially on today’s price... this is one ev which looked solid at one point and now is struggling
11/30/20, 12:28 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: One of features missing in TDA currently is fractional shares. I think fidelity supports it
11/30/20, 12:28 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: I like Fidelity active pro

11/30/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Glad to see the huge gains in stocks like zoom, shop and TTD... feeling great that had to buy more stocks to average out when they were falling further. Great experience and learning of buying when everyone sells !!

11/30/20, 1:37 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Learnt one thing that no point in taking 20-30% gain when the stocks have a potential to 1x 2x the investment in 2-3 years, at least that’s what I am hoping out of these businesses, might go wrong as my entry points are little high, but still lot of growth is there, hence will not sell till see significant changes in the fundamentals of these businesses.
Learnt this from my Tsla and sq investments, buy and sit tight let the awesome CEOs work to grow your money multiple folds.
11/30/20, 1:37 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: haven't used E Trade, but TDA is best. TDA has active trader featue, which is best for quickly setting and executing orders
11/30/20, 1:37 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Sounds good
11/30/20, 1:38 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I agree

11/30/20, 4:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Zoom results 

- Revenue growth of 366% to $777MM (10% beat)

- Non gaap eps of $0.99 (beat of 30%)

- Raised Q4 guidance to $809MM to $719MM consensus (12.5% beat)

- No of customers with $100k in revenue up 136%. Enterprise customer with >10 employee up 485% to 433k. 

Stock is down 5%, which is an exaggeration. I continue to be blown away with these numbers. There is nothing in the market of this size that generates this amount of growth or revenue.
11/30/20, 4:52 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Question is how will this number play in post covid scenario? I don’t think all of their subscriber will continue post covid and Zoo may have to settle down by 20-30% lower subscribers as a permanent ones. Your thought?
11/30/20, 5:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 50% estimated growth for next, still the best growth in the market
11/30/20, 5:02 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And btw zoom gas a habit if beating its estimates
11/30/20, 5:02 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Has a habbit
11/30/20, 5:03 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Zoomotopia has started and will expand its TAM
11/30/20, 5:04 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Offcourse there will be impact after reopening. The stock has not completed its run, and I will trim at an appropriate time when that happens
11/30/20, 5:04 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Zoom has opportunity to displace microsoft office and become defacto office software for all kind of enterprises in this new online remote colloborative space.
11/30/20, 5:06 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Without Covid, organisations would have taken at least 10-15 years to adopt to remote working model which they have adopted today, I guess Covid has pushed enterprises to adopt to it pretty quickly and it should stay.
Enterprises have understood that not all employees are required to be in the office premises to be productive. CXOs might cut their real estate or travel budget by using collaboration solutions even post Covid, there might be some slow down to zooms business but in long run they should be able to keep the momentum going.
11/30/20, 5:06 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I am surprised zoom isnt bidding for Slack and Asana and Zapier and canva etc
11/30/20, 5:07 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: True.
11/30/20, 5:41 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Is there some news on Tesla? It is up 5% after market.

11/30/20, 6:17 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Anand
11/30/20, 6:22 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Bought today Markit (INFO). Anyone any idea?
11/30/20, 6:22 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Seems more buying coming for Tesla by these index managers now.
11/30/20, 6:25 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Will run over soon once all fund managers buys? At what price one should trim some?
11/30/20, 6:35 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Wedbush has given a bull case price target of $1000, I am not planning to sell any, but if had to sell, I would have waited for the Q4 earning as I am sure that Tesla will deliver 180k vehicles this quarter (to meet the guidance they need to deliver 500k vehicles in FY-20) and should trade somewhere around 700-750, I would have targeted that to sell a few.
11/30/20, 6:36 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👍🏻🙏🏻
11/30/20, 7:27 PM - +1 (551) 580-3181: to add to this, there are few sectors where remote work is not possible. Such as scientific community, educational. They will need to be on premise. Post-covid definitely   there will be slowdown
11/30/20, 7:33 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I am not sure if that work was happening today using zoom, for example a miner or a manufacturing resource can’t be productive with zoom at all, he has to be in the office premises even today, hence I am optimistic of zoom.

11/30/20, 8:08 PM - +1 (732) 983-7189: 11 Stocks Turned $10,000 Into $931,533 In 11 Months
https://flip.it/LceoZ_
11/30/20, 9:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Market expects that slowdown, so growth estimates have fallen to 50% from a few hundred percent this year. The point that getting missed are the new areas that Zoom is expanding which will thrive in post covid world. 

- Launched zoom hardware as a service launching zoom phones and zoom rooms and integrate with the platform when people return to office.

- Launched Zoom marketplace to host and organize online event (buy and sell tickets). You may be in Pittsburgh but can attend  live fitness or yoga session, stand-up, concerts or music lessons in LA.

- Launched developers kit (API and SDK) for companies to develop and customize their own video platform (similar to Agora) and help them connect with their customers. 

While we view zoom as a videoconferencing platform, its more than what meets the eye as it is trying to become communication platform of the future.
11/30/20, 9:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There is no other company that is better positioned to achieve that. We as investors want to see that the company continues to execute in these other newer high growth areas.
11/30/20, 9:12 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍
11/30/20, 9:16 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It is giving Cisco a run for their money, Cisco already has most of these products required to complete the VS ecosystem and we all know that Webex is quite a great and successful collab platform, but Cisco’s market share has been shaken by Zoom.
Zoom clearly moved from the challenger’s quadrant to the leaders.
11/30/20, 9:16 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: *VC ecosystem
11/30/20, 9:42 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Then shoud we add more on the pullback tomorrow?
11/30/20, 9:46 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Did you not buy below $400
11/30/20, 9:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I see anytime it goes below $400 is a good time to buy
11/30/20, 10:08 PM - +1 (551) 580-3181: good insight 👍
11/30/20, 10:09 PM - +1 (551) 580-3181: 👍
11/30/20, 10:24 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Any idea or insights about BLNK?
11/30/20, 10:25 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Did we discuss BLNK before in this group?
11/30/20, 10:25 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Nope. 417.
11/30/20, 10:27 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I bought and sold. It shot up quite significantly in the last few weeks.
11/30/20, 10:28 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Someone recommended to buy SBE instead
11/30/20, 10:31 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: They are just riding the hype. Their market share is too low. And almost zero R&D investment.

Recommend to take a look at SBE instead. They have 73% market share and robust R&D.

11/30/20, 10:33 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: So basically avoid taking position
11/30/20, 10:33 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: thanks Aditya
11/30/20, 10:36 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Well that is up to you.. but I personally find SBE better. The underlying company is Charge Point and I have seen their EV charging stations. But didn’t see anything of Blink yet.
11/30/20, 10:37 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: ok..

When we get profits it doesn’t mean we are right and also when we get loss it doesn’t mean we are wrong 
What matters is consistency, for that we should always take calculated risk in stock market
12/1/20, 8:37 AM - +1 (408) 718-6359: 😆😆 it’s true
12/1/20, 8:39 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Too good

12/1/20, 9:20 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: do you recommend to enter in ZM at this current or shall we wait for it to go more down ?
12/1/20, 9:21 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I see $365-$395 as support for add ons
12/1/20, 9:22 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: However no harm in taking an initial position
12/1/20, 9:23 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And average down
12/1/20, 9:23 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I have few...thought to add more....anyway, will wait...
12/1/20, 9:23 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ok
12/1/20, 9:23 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Same here, I bought few yesterday before market close 🤣🤣
12/1/20, 9:28 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: A better way to play earnings (short term trade) is to invest a week or two before earnings and sell on the day of or day before release

This will work on most high quality stocks in bull market when they are in an uptrend.
12/1/20, 9:31 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Pretty confident that this has a much higher probability of gains rather than wishing for earnings spike.
12/1/20, 9:44 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: DTEA - look at it guys

12/1/20, 11:05 AM - +1 (201) 755-0082: Maybe pfizer vaccine has logistic issues with storage
12/1/20, 11:06 AM - +1 (201) 755-0082: moderna didnot report anything like that
12/1/20, 11:11 AM - +1 (908) 672-5619: Any one watching EARS

12/1/20, 11:20 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Coming Down
12/1/20, 11:23 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: yeah....lets see....recently it started going up on daily basis.

12/1/20, 11:35 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I informed this some days back also.
12/1/20, 11:40 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: In Nov also...

12/1/20, 12:12 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: It might go down further
12/1/20, 12:12 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: So wait n watch
12/1/20, 12:19 PM - +1 (301) 379-1284: Oh.
12/1/20, 12:34 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Nikola maat khelo, it's pure pump and dump
12/1/20, 12:58 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Right
12/1/20, 1:11 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: My average Nkla is 53. Lost pretty badly in it.
12/1/20, 1:14 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Oh no
12/1/20, 1:14 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Looks like it went to 94 wow
12/1/20, 1:15 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: My average is 29. When it went up to 54 last month I missed selling it by few cents. Now I'm stuck.
12/1/20, 1:17 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I was following it even before the merger, waited some time for it cool off from peaks, started buying at 70 😞. Continued to average down and stopped after some time.
12/1/20, 1:18 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Oh damn it
12/1/20, 1:18 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Oh man, that was close.
12/1/20, 1:18 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I have experienced something like this. Very hurt until now so can imagine
12/1/20, 1:19 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: The same happened with me on Taronis..TRNX. bought at 65 cents then 54 cents and then at 40 cents. Now its 3 cents lol
12/1/20, 1:19 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: @17325013097 MARA was a great suggestion. Thanks for that.
12/1/20, 1:26 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Any research on Tesla? Where it will be heading to?

Not sure which side it will turn..
12/1/20, 1:56 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Kaash aapka ye message pehle dekha hota ..
12/1/20, 2:00 PM - +1 (551) 222-1895: Any thoughts on NIO
Is it good time enter?
12/1/20, 2:02 PM - +1 (609) 216-4502: I could not trust Nikola after the news abt their fake ad showing truck rolling downhill spread. Then the founder got a golden handshake. Now GM reduced its scope  of contract. For a start up, those are some heavy adverse winds
12/1/20, 2:09 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: <Media omitted>
12/1/20, 2:10 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I still have the same question, how come it is still holding up on double digits, with a fraud hype and no product on the ground to sell, luckily I never entered in NKLA
12/1/20, 2:15 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: me neither, completely avoided NKLA
12/1/20, 2:15 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: For me it may be even. I made lot of money in nikola and lost huge too!
12/1/20, 2:16 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: One time I had 300 stocks at 30ish .. GM deal was announced and I made $6k next morning
12/1/20, 2:16 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: But I have lost huge too
12/1/20, 2:16 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s been fun ride Nikola
12/1/20, 2:16 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s a fraud for sure
12/1/20, 2:16 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Milton made billions and won’t go to jail either
12/1/20, 2:17 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Any bets on CRM earning today?
12/1/20, 2:18 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I have at 239.75
12/1/20, 2:19 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: By the way I apologize to someone on Moderna sell suggestion. In my mind there is nothing in the stock but it goes to 175 and to 135 pure pump and dump
12/1/20, 2:19 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: That person would have made more money
12/1/20, 2:19 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I apologize
12/1/20, 2:19 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I wish he didn’t listen to me
12/1/20, 2:28 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: By the way I had it short at $175 today but didn’t hold till end of the day otherwise it would have been some real $$.
12/1/20, 2:29 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: No stock can sustain this kind of rally. Moderna is 20% up everyday for 3 days in a row while Pfizer is not moving much!
12/1/20, 2:29 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It doesn’t make sense
12/1/20, 2:29 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Anyway
12/1/20, 2:30 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: <Media omitted>
12/1/20, 2:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I feel the same when I recommend something and it doesn't work. Its a huge obligation, so I prefer not to comment when I dont have skin in the game or don't feel strongly about something. 

I am assuming that everyone in this group understands that doing one's own due-diligence is key before listening to anyone on anything related to investment.
12/1/20, 2:38 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Normally when I recommend I own it too
12/1/20, 2:38 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I don’t recommend which I haven’t bought myself
12/1/20, 2:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: A disclaimer also helps that I try to include from time to time, but will be more consistent going forward.
12/1/20, 2:38 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Just an FYI
12/1/20, 2:39 PM - +1 (904) 521-4156: Any thoughts on SOLO ? Is it good time to enter to fill some loss?
12/1/20, 2:48 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: same for me
12/1/20, 2:48 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍👍.... I always add “I might be wrong though”
12/1/20, 3:00 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I bought it for $42 and add more if it goes down that level, I see good potential long term in the stocks hence would like to increase my position. If you want to enter please buy in phases only.
12/1/20, 3:01 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: And yes, I might be wrong though in expecting long term potential 😜😜😜
12/1/20, 3:02 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: It will suffer until the Senate remains undecided on chines stocks
12/1/20, 3:03 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: WORK buyout news look like false. What other suggest?
12/1/20, 3:04 PM - +1 (551) 222-1895: Got it thanks 😊
12/1/20, 3:04 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Nio CEO came forward yesterday and mentioned that he is ready for US audits as he has “nothing to hide”
12/1/20, 3:05 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Somebody was asking about CRM which has its quarterly results today. I use Salesforce at work and from that perspective I know it is continuing to do well. It was at last Q results when it jumped from $205 to $272 in a day. It's around $240 now. The slack acq will burn more cash reserves but Salesforce using acquisitions as a way to going one up on the competition (microsoft teams in this case) and is expected to benefit greatly from this acquisition.
12/1/20, 3:05 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Where did you read that?
12/1/20, 3:05 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Well they are atleast not scamsters like NKLA lol
12/1/20, 3:09 PM - +1 (650) 240-6540: Any advice on ROKU and SQ pls?
12/1/20, 3:09 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Last time I sold Nio for $6 just on this delisting thing, this time I am not going to succumb to it, I don’t think they will ever delist any Chinese stocks these are just political gimmicks.
12/1/20, 3:09 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: simple logic: These are very confidential and only out when done. ONLY leak when some technical issue in deal and may not go through... (pure my guess). I bought 36 put of next week
12/1/20, 3:10 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: 11 Dec 36 put at $0.40
12/1/20, 3:11 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: ROKU has more than doubled in last 2 months or so. I don't know if it has more immediate room to grow..certainly in long term. But I don't know short term.
12/1/20, 3:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I see Roku support between $240-$270 for an initial entry
12/1/20, 3:12 PM - +1 (650) 240-6540: Thanks Kunal and Nash. I am thinking a fresh entry and for a long term perspective.
12/1/20, 3:17 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Sq is a great business and might disrupt the traditional banking in long run, only issue is, the stock is too volatile, it falls pretty quickly and gains quickly as well. I am not an expert with buying levels but an entry can be made with a small amount at arnd 185-190 levels and then keep accumulating if it further falls
12/1/20, 3:18 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Bb down last 2 hrs
12/1/20, 3:22 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: NiO going down as well, it's 44 now

12/1/20, 3:24 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: $2 stock goes to $58. Now who wouldn’t book profit at that levels?
12/1/20, 3:25 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Looking at charts now. I had been an existing holder, and see support where I will be a buyer at $170-$175
12/1/20, 3:26 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I have not been able to spend much time otherwise I would have shorted NIO at $58 type and leave it there. Just been occupied at work lately
12/1/20, 3:27 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Same with XPEV
12/1/20, 3:29 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Once the air gets clear on delisting the stock will rally again, at that time it will be difficult to catch a running train. 
Please be mindful that they can’t just delist 2Trillion from the market.
I see good opportunity here.

12/1/20, 5:49 PM - +1 (973) 405-0388: I believe this is not a dilution due to stock offering. The article is misleading, but the market is already panic selling FSR

12/2/20, 9:14 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: NIO needed to be sold at $57. Valuations were too high. Can’t be twice the size of GM or Ford! Just unrealistic expectations.
12/2/20, 9:14 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Anything over $50 was bonus
12/2/20, 9:15 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: ohh WKHS

12/2/20, 10:14 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: One thing I have observed with workhorse is too dependent on the USPS deal, any positive news/rumour on contract announcement date will take it up back to high 20s. If you are in, hang in there don’t book loss.
12/2/20, 10:15 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: ok
12/2/20, 10:23 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They got some deal with AWS, but don't know what it means for their business. Also, can't tell from their charts if this is a one day spike or a bottom in place.
12/2/20, 10:24 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: it was highly volatile yesterday...I think it reached $9 and returned to below $8.....
12/2/20, 10:24 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I'll watch if this has good potential to go 50% up more from here.

12/2/20, 6:51 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Every investor is entitled to their own bias or views, so nothing personal. I on on the other side where i feel the big winner of 2021 will be chinese tech companies.

12/2/20, 7:49 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: What does this mean? Whatever position we have in these company like NKLA, NIO, Li etc will be 0?
12/2/20, 7:56 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: When a company is delisted, its stock no longer trades on one of the major stock exchanges. In a direct sense, nothing happens to a shareholder when delisting occurs. The shareholder still owns the same percentage of the company as before, and he is free to sell the shares to any willing buyer. But the question is who will buy ?😁
12/2/20, 7:57 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: So technically it means it is 0
12/2/20, 8:01 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Once a stock is delisted from a main exchange, it will be relegated to trading in the OTCBB or the Pink Sheets. These loosely regulated exchanges do not provide easy access to everyone to trade.
12/2/20, 8:28 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I had it on Monday and Tuesday too!
12/2/20, 8:29 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: NKLa is an American innovative company so don’t worry! It will hit $2500 soon
12/2/20, 8:29 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s just initial struggles just like Tesla
12/2/20, 8:30 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Nikola Tesla was a great inventor!
12/2/20, 8:31 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: SharmaJi uphaas kar rahe ho aap? :-)
12/2/20, 8:31 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: But nikola Tesla is no more... and the way they are going company also will be no more 😀

12/2/20, 8:32 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Nikola ka jab truck aayega market main tab dekhna aap
12/2/20, 8:33 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: You meant toy truck 😜
12/2/20, 8:33 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Just kidding
12/2/20, 8:33 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: chaliye ab to waqt bataiyega ki kya hoga NKLA ka
12/2/20, 8:33 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Everyone would want a piece of it but by that time it’s stock would be so expensive .. logon ko ek tire ke barabar ka hissa hi khareed payenge
12/2/20, 8:34 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Like pizza slice but not a whole pizza
12/2/20, 8:34 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: American Trucks running on Hydrogen technology. Just hear these words and you see innovation
12/2/20, 8:34 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s amazing!!
12/2/20, 8:34 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: I initially had faith.. bought it, and then came out on first chance... with the ev frenzy, never know it can go anywhere.. people are getting crazy with ev word

12/3/20, 10:52 AM - +1 (201) 850-0875: Even after this bill, Chinese companies will have 3 years before the desisting takes place. Exchanges also work on a separate feasible solution. Taking $2T from market is not viable, I feel.
12/3/20, 10:54 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Agree
12/3/20, 10:55 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Along with trump this bill will also go to the drains, they can’t take 2Tn off market, but this defiantly makes these stocks super risky. At the same time rewards will be huge too if things go in favour.
12/3/20, 10:55 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: *Definitely
12/3/20, 10:58 AM - +1 (201) 850-0875: The higher the risk, the higher the rewards. 😊

12/3/20, 11:18 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Docu has a habbit of beating earnings and revenue. Since this is consolidating in the range, I am hoping this will break out, if it beats and guide out of the park.
12/3/20, 11:19 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: That said, I always view playing earnings as speculation.
12/3/20, 11:19 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: We will know more today.
12/3/20, 11:55 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: ZS is up 25% today 😮

12/3/20, 1:56 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I am approx 70% invested in TSLA, I am not looking to trim it but will see if it reaches arnd 700 on the 18th Dec might sell some.
12/3/20, 1:56 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It’s a million dollar question 😃 No one knows
12/3/20, 1:56 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Forecast is huge for it.

12/3/20, 2:08 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: This TSLA bull is all in in TSLA, made 3Mn in 5 years, so 30-50-70% doesn’t matter. Staying invested in TSLA is important!
12/3/20, 2:23 PM - +1 (551) 232-6566: I hope he , you and me  do not go back to our 2017-2018 portfolio 😁😁
12/3/20, 2:24 PM - +1 (201) 724-0889: 👍
12/3/20, 2:31 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I had no portfolio in 2017-18, I just started in 2020, and was lucky to be invested in TSLA, so I don’t have much to lose here😁.
Having said that, post 21st December, there might be a pullback for TSLA, the index funds will add TSLA on the 18th, the stock might see huge upside and from 21st might see a downward trend or trade sideways. 
This is the first time in the history a company with 500Bn market cap is getting added to S&P500, it’s a big event and there is no historical data to predict anything, am excited for the 18th!

12/4/20, 10:38 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: I am taking a small position ~500 if it stays above 9.50
12/4/20, 10:40 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Ok then I will take smaller 🙂 position. For short term profit booking (hopefully).

12/4/20, 2:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yolo continue to do well.  Apart from etf, I am doing research on high quality cannabis companies for medium to longer term play, that will benefit from Biden deregulation.

I have started of a position in Green Thumb industries at $21. There are others that I am watching and will enter at an adequate time.
12/4/20, 2:41 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 😂👍🏻🍾
12/4/20, 2:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I have sold off my investment in Agora at breakeven around $40 price. This has been the only underperforming investment in my portfolio that I had discussed here. Since we are in a bull market, we cannot afford to underperform on any investment for months. There are always better opportunities for our capital, and all of stocks should behave like winners, otherwise they risk losing their spot in the portfolio.
12/4/20, 2:48 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Even POTN is on the rise. 50%up.

12/4/20, 2:55 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I will make NIO my wife at $25 or below
12/4/20, 2:55 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Until then it’s a girlfriend
12/4/20, 2:56 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: OMG ... and when NIO on 100, you will bhagwaan RAM and wife ko chor doge

12/4/20, 3:34 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I am in the boat with you.  I averaged. But Not as much invested as you are though.

12/4/20, 4:07 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: GTBIF is a longer term play on US cannabis market, versus ACB or Tilray which focuses on Canadian market. I think the market opportunity is significant here vs Canada (which is oversupplied). GTBIF is also profitable and generating 100% revenue growth vs the other two losing money like there is no tomorrow. 

Since I am playing for longer term, it is entirely possible for GTBIF to underperform other canadian penny stocks in the near term, but pretty confident of its potential over the long term.
12/4/20, 4:08 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Others that I am looking but have not found an attractive buy point are Curaleaf and Trulieve Cannabis
12/4/20, 4:09 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Point hai 😀
12/4/20, 4:10 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: इतना सम्मान NIO ko? Worth 45🤔🙂
12/4/20, 4:12 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Enlighten plz. on this stock..worth buying? Thank you in advance.
12/4/20, 4:13 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thanks.
12/4/20, 4:15 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I have been watching Curaleaf as well...Please announce here when you find an entry point...What is the ticker for Trulieve?
12/4/20, 4:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: TCNNF

12/4/20, 4:55 PM - +1 (518) 256-7108: 🤣
12/4/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Is this still a good hold for long term. Hasnt moved in last few months
12/4/20, 6:04 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: <Media omitted>
12/4/20, 6:07 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Moved from $14 to $21. Little volatile chart, but no issues as of now
12/4/20, 6:09 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Cool thanks

12/4/20, 7:22 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I did add at $5 couple of days back, planning to hold it for long term, once they expand their operations in more tourist destinations the stock should rise and we never know if it get listed in mainstream, there should be a huge surge, add if you plan to hold it for 2-3 quarters at least.
12/4/20, 7:23 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👍🏻will add some more on Monday.
12/4/20, 7:25 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I see good potential in the stock, did some more research and found that they have their own products which are quite popular, they might open more retail dispensaries just for their products along with full fledged planet 13 stores, next one year would be critical for them as MJ gets legalised across US
12/4/20, 7:27 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: However, my primary holding is still grwg.I will go slow on planet 13, as I am more bullish on grwg as it is main stream and trades in nasdaq.
12/4/20, 7:42 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Are you talking abt PLANF?
12/4/20, 7:43 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Plnhf
12/4/20, 7:48 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: I too have PLNHF. So far so good. Highly speculative position though.
12/4/20, 7:54 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Risk hai to ishk hai bhai😂😂😂
12/4/20, 8:00 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Ok
12/4/20, 8:01 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: 😀👍  bas difference yahi ishq mein sab luta dete hain yahan jitna jhel sako utna. SPCE is another speculative position
12/4/20, 8:06 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 😂😂😂 it was a dialogue from 1992 Scam, the Harshad Mehta series, liked it so quoted it here.
12/4/20, 8:43 PM - +1 (908) 938-3211: Harshad Mehta was real hero... I have lots of respect for this guy after watching his series
12/4/20, 8:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: This one looks good 👍
12/4/20, 8:59 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: This is a penny stock, pumped and dumped during 2017 crazy buying. I would stay away from it, but it was a favorite for many.
12/4/20, 9:08 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Literally, he was too sharp and way ahead of his time. He did force SEBI to regulate Indian stock market, all the big shots of today’s Indian stock market like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, RK damani etc paani bharte the uske samne. Wish he was alive and active today in the market, des me talent ki kadar hi nahi hai, I guess isiliye hum sab yaha hai ... Saat samundar paar😂😂😂, just kidding.
12/4/20, 9:09 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash, means a lot coming from you that we are on the right track👍
12/4/20, 10:00 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Yep. Will definitely add more on Monday then🙂

12/4/20, 10:29 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: One of my favorite stocks 😊
12/4/20, 10:51 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I know 😄. I didn’t know how you feel, so didn’t take names 😂
12/5/20, 12:05 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Khareed lena hai kya isko?
12/5/20, 8:24 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Weed is a habit and people will do anything for habit. No matter what but habit will be the first priority always...So no doubt on business going down...And sone pe suhaga when this is a legal business...But it’s a new entrant. So not tested for returns. Hence high risk high reward...I took a smal position And I will not tell you how many this time😀) and am going to add more on Monday. And will keep adding as it goes up...However I will never recommend selling all of yours CRM and buying all of this one stock 🙂. And BTW it’s not a Chinese stock so you may take a call. Good luck.
12/5/20, 8:34 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: 😀👍
12/5/20, 8:50 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Ok theek hai “small” position le lenge Monday ko
12/5/20, 8:50 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Kisi aur account main
12/5/20, 8:51 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Waise CRM $470 ka stock hai bhai abhi cheap main mil raha hai .. Christmas sale
12/5/20, 8:54 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Honestly I have made a mistake in CRM by averaging out. I had gains if I sold out just before earnings. But again I don’t have a crystal ball. In hindsight if I had to average out it had to be next morning not in after hour on the ER day!
12/5/20, 8:55 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I have no choice but for it to come back up! Just wait and wait and wait!!!

12/6/20, 9:17 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-2021-outlooks-coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-equities-162339169.html
12/6/20, 10:04 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The strategists are coming up with 4000 S&P handle today. We had discussed it multiple times after S&P crossed 2500-2700 range. 

Per EW, today we are in the midst of the 3rd wave (the most bullish phase) after we hit the 3200 low in Oct, so all pullbacks will be bought. 

There is a reasonable probability that we go to 4000-4500 next to complete the 3rd wave before a 4th wave pullback starts, followed by 5th and final rally. Wishing the market be with you 👍
12/6/20, 10:14 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Super 👍
12/6/20, 10:24 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Not trying to sound negative but shouldn’t market be a reflection of the economy. Economy is bad, we have 700k job losses every week. How long can market continue to go higher?
12/6/20, 10:44 AM - +1 (551) 232-6566: That’s right.. something is missing here. How long market can keep zooming where in reality productivity is doing down every week.
12/6/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (551) 232-6566: Is it that money printing will continue forever and this inflationary cycle will continue and market will never come down.
12/6/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Look at BA .. it’s trading as if nothing is wrong!
12/6/20, 10:46 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Airlines - trading as if all is well!
12/6/20, 10:46 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Cruise - not even operational
12/6/20, 10:46 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Profits are down but stock price is much much higher
12/6/20, 10:47 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Something is not right
12/6/20, 10:54 AM - +1 (917) 375-5298: Until everyone became bullish market will continue to rally ... Just follow your system and follow your trend. We shouldn't try to identify top or bottom , or not to try to predict the price. I have learnt this from V. Tharp and Mr. Glenn Neely. Just sharing it.
12/6/20, 10:55 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: <Media omitted>
12/6/20, 11:02 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: It’s not Economy but pandemic...Investors are riding the hope of getting things normal and wanna be ahead of the game and do not miss the opportunity before it becomes normal/costly. They want to buy when it’s still cheaper....For example AA has been a profitable company and there is no way of $14 valuation...It’s just because of the pandemic...And investors know that it will be normal soon; worst in a year now when the light is very clear at the end of the tunnel.
12/6/20, 12:42 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Is Roblox a Chinese company? What does it mean “launching in China”?
12/6/20, 12:44 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I think it is american company
12/6/20, 12:45 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: That’s what I thought. Need to find out more. I am already spending money for in-game purchases in Roblox.
12/6/20, 4:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The market is forward looking indicator and cannot and should not be confused with the economy. I have written in details about this.  The way I see this is the economy has only gotten better from the unemployment and GDP plunge in 2q-2020 (which market forecasted in 1q-2020). Third quarter delivered double digit economic growth significantly improvement in unemployment numbers. 4th quarter and beyond will ride the vaccine and reopen tailwind.
12/6/20, 4:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The market performs the best when things changes from negative to less negative. It is the rate of change which matters. This has been evidenced by the 68% rally from the low in March.
12/6/20, 4:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: That's a good point. The only issue with trending market is markets are non linear structure and can move sideways for very long periods of time. This is evidenced by market doing nothing 2000-2008 (rise, plunge, rise and plunge).

The good thing today is that markets are trending linearly, so we can benefit from that, but that will not always be the case in the future.
12/6/20, 4:46 PM - +1 (551) 232-6566: Yup.. negative to less negative.. that’s all what matters in short term.
12/6/20, 4:48 PM - +1 (732) 910-9764: Guys any suggestions for trading apps or site to use with less/least fee?
12/6/20, 4:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: These are very interesting IPO's. I like a few, but will need to see how the market reacts on pricing
12/6/20, 4:49 PM - +1 (732) 910-9764: I was on Robinhood long ago before I had close it for compliance reasons.
12/6/20, 4:55 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: I would suggest TD Ameritrade unless u want to trade futures
12/6/20, 6:07 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: I use and like Td ameritrade, it is a good one. If you need a refferal feel free to PM your email id.
12/6/20, 6:45 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: I was waiting for Wish.
12/6/20, 8:20 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Wish excites me more than others. Are you planning on buying any right after their IPO?
12/6/20, 10:21 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: Will wait and then buy
12/7/20, 12:33 AM - +1 (213) 568-8440: I am on RobinHood and Webull,   feel free to ping me,  I can give invite...
Thanks
12/7/20, 8:10 AM - +1 (609) 216-4502: just curious, is it possible  to participate in private placement just before an IPO is listed - like via their underwriters
12/7/20, 9:42 AM - +1 (201) 423-6408: I think fidelity allows that if portfolio > 500 k. Varies by stock though
12/7/20, 10:11 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Any one had issue with RH
12/7/20, 10:11 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Not able to place the orders
12/7/20, 10:15 AM - +1 (201) 423-6408: It seems it was down now it is working

12/7/20, 10:18 AM - +1 (502) 296-0435: What are we buying ?
12/7/20, 10:19 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Couldn’t buy this morning, was playing these days on PLTR
12/7/20, 10:19 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Call and PUT
12/7/20, 10:21 AM - +1 (502) 296-0435: 👍🏻
12/7/20, 10:22 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Also, with teslas due date coming closer to 18th. There is expected to be huge swings on tesla in general. That will be on my watch constantly. I am thinking it will carry other ev stocks along with it. Particularly NIO
12/7/20, 10:27 AM - +1 (551) 232-6566: Any idea why ITA is 50% down.. any glitch or there is a split.

12/7/20, 11:23 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Guys be careful with Chinese stocks
12/7/20, 11:24 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: This was fake sales EV hupe
12/7/20, 11:24 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Hype
12/7/20, 11:24 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Look at XPEV .. issues stock offering and raised billions
12/7/20, 11:25 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Again, it may be just me but be cautious
12/7/20, 11:27 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: 👍🏻👍🏻
12/7/20, 11:28 AM - +1 (480) 252-1728: Kandi is 10% up today, does this negative news not impacting stock price
12/7/20, 11:28 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s good that lot of you are bullish on Chinese market but again exercise caution!

12/7/20, 12:16 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: QCOM CRWD are 52 week  high ..is going short (buying Put)a good idea?
12/7/20, 12:34 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: What about Roku?
12/7/20, 12:39 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Even Roku is 52 week high
12/7/20, 12:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There will be 100's of stocks at all time high? Should we short all?
12/7/20, 12:44 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: That’s the question i have .. like these Ok to short ? Or do we need to keep other things while shorting or buying puts ?
12/7/20, 12:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I personally think BA is a weak stock and can be shorted 😜😜
12/7/20, 12:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I just did for fun at 243.5
12/7/20, 12:45 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Not saying to short but asking it is going to be a good trade to short / buying put
12/7/20, 12:45 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Let’s see
12/7/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Just because stock is all time high doesn't mean that it cannot go any higher. In a bull market, stock remains at all time high most of the time.
12/7/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I think market is too much bull
12/7/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Faltu main
12/7/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Crash is needed

12/7/20, 12:47 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Companies are not as worthy as they look now
12/7/20, 12:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You need to find a bogey for shorting (eg bad news followed by reversal candle or view of the market that its going down). Anything else is pure speculation to lose good money
12/7/20, 12:47 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: All of them must crash by 20-30%
12/7/20, 12:47 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Markets are running on bullish momentum blindly because of stimulus news... They are anticipating deal. to finalise this week possibly.. That's why all precious metals are also running... Again all  of them are tagging the top for this year between 3740 to max 3800.  So puts will definitely work as a hedge currently for your calls and will work best overall when markets makes one final push once stimulus is announced.
12/7/20, 12:47 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: So in your opinion not a good idea   To short for these ..

12/7/20, 12:48 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Ok
12/7/20, 12:49 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Airlines or cruise stocks for June /July

12/7/20, 12:49 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: This should not be the reason for put...Besides CRWD is the future. A long term stock. It may be risky to play put with this...But you never know. You may have a lucky finger🙂
12/7/20, 12:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep
12/7/20, 12:50 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Got it thanks
12/7/20, 12:50 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: I was asking pltr
12/7/20, 12:50 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah, but its all about timing in option. The stock may go up 100% before declining 20%
12/7/20, 12:50 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Your vroom is zooming today...Still much below my cost...will exit at 50.

12/7/20, 12:51 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: one reason for this is - money rotation into emerging markets.  Check out EEM, it has been on the rise, meaning money moving into Emerging market.
12/7/20, 12:52 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I am not expecting much in Dec. historically dec has been a good month. Unless something major happens as Democrat wins senate or election fraud is proved and so on...so be careful with what you do.
12/7/20, 12:53 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Not expecting much in sense market crashing...in my opinion it will not in Dec if you believe in historical trend.
12/7/20, 12:54 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👏
12/7/20, 12:55 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Any idea about BBY .. why is it going down down .. what is the actual support ? I initially thought 109 then 104 now it is 102 .. i mean kahan tak niche jayega ? Any idea?
12/7/20, 12:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
12/7/20, 12:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I mentioned this on Aug 1. The performance so far has been phenomenol
12/7/20, 1:00 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: OPTION LOVERS-
1)- BJs has come down in spite of good result. BJs is like Lowe’s of Homedepot. Walks slow...I see an opportunity for OPTION
2)- Coca-Cola- has been a lagger. Still down 15% from high. I have a significant OPTIONA position for APR 2021-June21. And I am optimistic. 
3)- Same for AT&T. I have a significant OPTION position for Apr15th.
12/7/20, 1:01 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Spot on, I missed to read your post back in Aug, but I agree with all three points and this is one reason for me being bullish on emerging market stks.
12/7/20, 1:01 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: But as you know option can become zero. So play wisely. And don’t put all the eggs in one basket. I only have less than 10% of my portfolio in options. Rest in stock.
12/7/20, 1:05 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I just posted my few option position. See if you like.
12/7/20, 1:13 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Thank you Ravi .. will check now
12/7/20, 1:17 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👍🏻. Be careful. Don’t be greedy. And recommended to put small portion of your portfolio in option...Once (6/7 years ago) I had my 80% invested in option...market crashed and I lost $35k 😡😡.
12/7/20, 1:19 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Haha .. yes i will be ..losing 35k is scary
12/7/20, 1:19 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: I  lost some in WKHS  LAST WEEK
12/7/20, 1:22 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Sometimes it’s advisable to go for a longer term option...so even if the stock comes down after you buy there will be a chance of bounce back...As long as the company is good and you have done your research on what period/strike price option to buy. It may play out ok with except when market crashes it takes all stock along.
12/7/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Agreed
12/7/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: No one knows where is Tesla heading to :)
12/7/20, 1:32 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: To the Moon and then to the Mars it seems 🤪

I thought it would be around 700 on the 18th, but it seems it’s gonna be there this week itself
12/7/20, 1:59 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Pata bhai bhai

12/7/20, 3:14 PM - +1 (609) 216-4502: Rajnish, thanks for this 👍
12/7/20, 3:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yes, I had taken a starter position at $68. I think its one of the most undermonetized feel-good social media platform with a long runway for growth. The platform is better suited for advertising vs Facebook and snaps of the world.
12/7/20, 3:42 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: LAZR - any one following?
12/7/20, 3:42 PM - +1 (727) 248-1546: Thanks Nash

12/7/20, 3:50 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: This CEO of this company is very young guys only 22 year old
12/7/20, 3:50 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 25 yr old I think
12/7/20, 3:51 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Ohk

12/7/20, 3:54 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Symbolic tweet from Musk 😂
12/7/20, 3:59 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Yep. I had bought some on Friday. And added further today.
12/7/20, 4:01 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Is it good to have in long term ?
12/7/20, 4:01 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Doubled from Thursday close. In two days.
12/7/20, 4:01 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: LAZR ?

12/7/20, 4:02 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I have not done much research on this company so am not in a position to advise. But looked good to me prima facie. Musk does not like this.
12/7/20, 4:14 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Vxrt 50 percent up in last 1 month, any one following this?
12/7/20, 4:32 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Thanks for suggestions guys 👍

12/7/20, 10:22 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Tesla is a joke!
12/7/20, 10:23 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: What is the basis on this kind of valuation!
12/7/20, 10:23 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s a dangerous stock and must fall 90%
12/7/20, 10:26 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: $3250 pre split
12/7/20, 10:26 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Mazak bana rakha hai stock market ne
12/7/20, 10:26 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: $300 se upar ek paisa nahi hona chahiye iska
12/7/20, 10:28 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: They just make cars which is not supposed to be high margin business. How long can this nonsense last? Wallstreet is getting ready to fuck this ticker royally!!
12/7/20, 10:30 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: In share market the real value of any company is not its assets and income/profit margin .. it is what people think it’s value is 😀
12/7/20, 10:31 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: That was the perception about Apple. How come a hardware company can become a trillion $ empire!!! It’s innovation and brand loyalty.
12/7/20, 10:32 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Yes they innovative approach and technology is making them valuable. It’s not just about car any more it’s ecosystem now
12/7/20, 10:33 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Apple is a cash cow! They have $200bn of cash. How much cash does Tesla have?
12/7/20, 10:35 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Apple does over $250bn of revenue and make $50bn+ profit every year! That’s solid business and commands that kind of respect.

12/7/20, 10:37 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Now they have. Once upon a time they did not have either...They failed multiple times before became successful...Tesla is equally innovator and market disruptor...Give it some time... No one in the entire world is even close where they are in EV.
12/7/20, 10:37 PM - +1 (732) 325-8310: This message was deleted
12/7/20, 10:37 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Tesla’s revenue will be about 30bn and  about 1bn net income
12/7/20, 10:38 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Not even comparable
12/7/20, 10:39 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: profit is 2% of Apple but market value is 33% .. it’s a joke!!
12/7/20, 10:39 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Revenue is 10% too
12/7/20, 10:41 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Future TESLA ka hi hai 😀
12/7/20, 10:41 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Kya pata kal apple hi Tesla ko acquire kar le 😎

12/7/20, 10:47 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Send me money. I can do on your behalf🙂. Seriously. Profit/loss aapka.

12/7/20, 10:56 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I was also thinking like Upkar and did not buy it until a few weeks back. And it’s already up 40%. Thinking about people who unlike me entered long back.
12/7/20, 10:56 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bhai gain le kar nikal lo
12/7/20, 10:56 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 40 taka in few weeks is a lot
12/7/20, 10:56 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: In 2020 Tesla seems to have done the Honors to the wall street folks, only Cathy woods could cash on Tesla’s Rally, rest all were busy shorting thinking TSLA was overpriced.
12/7/20, 10:57 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Dude you don't know but lots of dude on this group made shitload on Tesla.
12/7/20, 10:58 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: While every dipshit on wall street was shorting, we were long tesla always.
12/7/20, 10:58 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Himmat hai to put lijiye 😀
12/7/20, 10:59 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Right...Not only in this group, lot of retail investors made loads of money, while wallstreet kept shorting it
12/7/20, 10:59 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Put is time sensitive. I can’t predict when will it drop. Short is easier
12/7/20, 10:59 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Yahi soch kar kuchh share 580 par nikal gaye the. Aaj pachta rahe hain.
12/7/20, 10:59 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bahut Achcha kiya bhai
12/7/20, 11:00 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Lot of NIO lovers didn’t cash at $55+

12/7/20, 11:03 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Yup check P/E ration:
Apple P/E ration: 37
Tesla P/E ratio: 1197.2 - 😱
12/7/20, 11:04 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: True. Probably first time retail investors have earned from institutional investors
12/8/20, 7:33 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Tsla going down pre market, any news?
12/8/20, 7:34 AM - +1 (310) 748-7761: 5b at market offering of new shares

12/8/20, 9:39 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Mazak chal raha hai bhai
12/8/20, 9:39 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Tesla is joke!

12/8/20, 9:41 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: And Upkar was raising concerns about Tesla’s cash reserves 😜😜😜
12/8/20, 9:41 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Paisa nahi hain tabhi to company bechne aa gaye bhai
12/8/20, 9:41 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Offering is selling a piece of company
12/8/20, 9:41 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Agree, it’s senseless.
12/8/20, 9:42 AM - +1 (310) 748-7761: There is a chatter on tesla india announcement

12/8/20, 9:51 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It’s in its initial phase of growth, you are being too harsh on TSLA, either ride it or ignore it.
12/8/20, 10:03 AM - +1 (646) 413-2283: Tesla is good to have if it crashes as they have a successful business and are now making money. Almost all other car makers have said that they admire Tesla!! Also Tesla is a brand. I am sure if Elon sells slippers with Tesla written on it then it will sell well too.
12/8/20, 10:14 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: YQ is up ~40% in two sessions

12/8/20, 1:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: That said, the stock is up 50% within a month. Congrats to all who were not scared by the fall and bought on the dips
12/8/20, 1:46 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: 👍🏻 😜

12/8/20, 1:50 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Based on that logic when will CRM come back ?
12/8/20, 1:50 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Hmm
12/8/20, 1:51 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I am still holding all of it

12/8/20, 2:26 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 😔
12/8/20, 2:40 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: it was already at $5.4 pre-market
12/8/20, 2:42 PM - +1 (908) 672-5619: Now it passed 7$ and 390% up
12/8/20, 2:46 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: To track these kind of Bio stocks we should start with the FDA Calendar where you can find the Trial phase and then accordingly analyze which stock to buy when. It is a risky affair because if the data submitted or FDA disapproves the trial the stock tanks same way as it shoots for approval.

12/8/20, 2:47 PM - +1 (631) 429-6726: Its phase 1 study of its drug CA 4948 showed tremendous response to leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome, stock up 400 % today
12/8/20, 2:48 PM - +1 (631) 429-6726: Blood cancer is most dangerous, it should have large market, Curis market cap is still 369 mil
12/8/20, 2:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Could have easily gone the other way. I think its tough to trade/invest in clinical stage biotechnology companies
12/8/20, 2:51 PM - +1 (631) 429-6726: True but he was the lucky one today😊
12/8/20, 2:52 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: agree INO and ibio another examples of such
12/8/20, 2:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Inline with the above, love to get research on what % of stock goes up vs down on the day of the trial, and the average gain/loss
12/8/20, 2:56 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Nash - what’s your view on CRM? It’s not able to cross $230. When will people show some love on this solid stock?
12/8/20, 2:56 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: news came today or may be after market yesterday.....by the time market opens it bumped up from $1.42 to %5.40 . Someone knows already abt it.
12/8/20, 2:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Everything else is gambling
12/8/20, 2:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Insiders may be?
12/8/20, 2:57 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I also suspect the same
12/8/20, 2:58 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Pre market raise, definitely insiders
12/8/20, 2:58 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: and we need such guy in this group 😄
12/8/20, 2:58 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: We all will be in trouble
12/8/20, 2:58 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: Yes this is pure gamble unless and until you have insight of the technology of the clinical study and believe. Normally small companies will explode after positive results.
12/8/20, 3:38 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: guy must have lot of courage and money to invest $18k in a $1 stock
12/8/20, 3:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: CRM is one of the best large cap company for the digital future and Mark Benioff is a visionary. The success of Salesforce has been embedded on the acquisitions they have made over the years. While some would call Benioff as reckless, he has  one of the best hands in integrating smaller companies and retaining key talent in his company. This has led CRM to grow at roughly a 20% compounded rate over the last 20 years. 

In the short term, market punishes acquirer for overpaying (which is what happened with the slack acquisition), but over long period of time, he has been successful with Tableau to Mulesoft to Quip to name a few, each time allowing Salesforce to either grow vertically or horizontally in its business. 

Mark is now setting up his sight to compete with Microsoft with the Slack acquisition. While we don't know if he will be successful in this, but if the future of work is collaboration and work from anywhere (which i think is based on my ownership of zoom), this acquisition will be as productive as his past ones.

12/8/20, 3:43 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I agree. Won't change much in near term but it will do very well over long term. I got into it in 140s and then bought some more at 181. Still holding all of them.
12/8/20, 3:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Analyst target price is 25% above current levels if you give them weight
12/8/20, 3:49 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: That is where it was in September, a day after its Q result when it increased from 205 to 272 in one day.

12/8/20, 4:13 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: No. I messed up. I think total portfolio 35k out of which 26k in one stock. That’s pretty aggressive and must be in great tips.
12/8/20, 4:15 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 😀
12/8/20, 4:16 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Absolutely. Otherwise no one will put 80% of portfolio in just one stock.
12/8/20, 4:16 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Nope. Just  one guy. 😀
12/8/20, 4:29 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Yeah, really crazy
12/8/20, 4:33 PM - +1 (201) 423-6408: Anyone watching TUSK

12/8/20, 5:52 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: What expensive! I guess there is a market for it or they will do amazing hype to make the market for the product
12/8/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Yeah need to see how it goes , they did a mistake with Homepod launching for $329 at times when alexa and google were cheaper
12/8/20, 5:58 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Don’t know where we are heading to. It’s insane
12/8/20, 6:03 PM - +1 (201) 755-0082: Will really depend on how good they are. There are many other premium brands in $1000+ range also
12/8/20, 6:07 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: For sure. I’m just unaware of that market segment. Others 1000+ ones will come crashing perhaps 😃
12/8/20, 6:44 PM - +1 (732) 692-0317: Did any body subscribed this ? Any feed back?

12/8/20, 7:12 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 1000+ is too much, I have Bose QC35 for last 3 years, amazing noise cancelling and acoustics still works like new, bought it for 36k united miles, it retailed for around $400 approx
12/8/20, 7:14 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Beats and Sony also has similar products in the similar range, I am surprised to see a new product from Apple when they already owns Beats
12/8/20, 7:18 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Did anyone test their batteries independently to validate their claims?
12/8/20, 7:31 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I am trying to find more, but looks like so far these are all claims only.
12/9/20, 9:40 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Tsla, going down crazy
12/9/20, 9:42 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: $10 drop is not crazy!
12/9/20, 9:42 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Unless it drops $65 or more it’s not crazy

12/9/20, 12:36 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: True SNOW looking at current price around 400 looked cheap at 220, not sure it will go back there
12/9/20, 12:38 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: The analyst will either make his career or break his career 😃 Most likely later
12/9/20, 12:38 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: That Analyst is living in dream 😴
12/9/20, 12:38 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I hope the analyst is not Apne upkar bhai😂😂
12/9/20, 12:39 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Could be, but analyst will soon be apkar bhai
12/9/20, 12:40 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Upkar bhai has raised very valid point. No one disagrees that Tesla is super overvalued. Even Elon feels that too
12/9/20, 12:41 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Now there are analysts you thinks Tesla will go to 90 and there are analysts who says Tesla will go to 2500$

Koi sar par nahi hai Tesla ka
12/9/20, 12:41 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Who on this planet thought that Tesla will be 700B $ company 😃
12/9/20, 12:42 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Many bulls are hopeful it to be 3T soon

12/9/20, 12:55 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Dash not available for trading in robinhood.... and what crazy valuations these ipos are... ai- expected 42 opening at 100+
12/9/20, 12:56 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Analysts ke chakkar me lakhon ka nuksan hua hai.. 😀😀did not buy Tesla at all☹️
12/9/20, 12:57 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: C3.AI opinions?

12/9/20, 1:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They were initially contemplating 30-$32, raised it to $42, I had a limit order at $50😛
12/9/20, 1:07 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Thats for AI
12/9/20, 1:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Public market does not care about valuation in the short run particularly for transformative companies like AI and Snowflake.  

For eg, AI is trading at $16bn market cap with $150Mm in revenues and growing at 70% recently. One of my all time favorite Crowdstrike is growing at 80% rate has 3x the revenue as AI but only at 2x the value (seems like its 33% cheap)
12/9/20, 1:33 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Tesla free fall

12/9/20, 3:37 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: What suggestion for Tesla put 550

12/9/20, 4:26 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: I bought TESLA PUT on Monday after selling my stock at 643
12/9/20, 4:26 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Expire on Friday 12/11
12/9/20, 4:29 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Good luck,
12/9/20, 4:32 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: I sold my PUT already today
12/9/20, 4:40 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Do you work at JPM?, how sure you were in buying the put on monday😁, jpm analyst price target news came today
12/9/20, 5:05 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: He is sane person! Got it right this time.
12/9/20, 5:06 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: He is great analyst .. whoever it is!
12/9/20, 5:07 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Anyone analyst who is bullish on Tesla now is on TLRY weed!!
12/9/20, 5:08 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s all fake bubble. They make cars that is not a high margin business. Ab usmain kitna bhi software daal do car to car hi rahegi.
12/9/20, 5:09 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Weed is legal now .. Must have tried it already! Traditional automakers are not going to sit back and just manufacture gasoline cars.
12/9/20, 5:10 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Ye sab bas short ke pahale ka nasha hai .. Tesla game is over. If they don’t deliver great result in upcoming quarter it will go to 300 and $90 the JPM analyst predicted
12/9/20, 5:11 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It is quite a possibility with the kind of cash they generate every year. $50bn cash every year
12/9/20, 5:11 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: As per VIX data, very much chance for red market between 9-16 dec. so I take risk and bought multiple stock PUT target either 11 dec or 18 dec. all print today. Sold few and keep some for next week.

12/10/20, 7:29 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Tesla heavy sell off
12/10/20, 8:17 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I do not feel good with doordash valuation. Taking off from my tracking list. It may fell miserably after pandemic is over....ANY THOUGHT??
12/10/20, 8:17 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Yup, I sold my $ printer yesterday
12/10/20, 8:17 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It’s a horrible share. It is to pay off the creditors and investors.
12/10/20, 8:17 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Agree!
12/10/20, 8:19 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Keep an eye on FEAC which is under the radar spac that acquired Skillz, a  gaming marketplace for competitive gaming. It is one of the fastest growing esport/gaming company and has twice been CNBC disruptor. Harry Sloan is the founder, who has been involved in entertainment business for 20 yrs and is board member of Draftking. 

Its an existing company in my portfolio at $12.5, but Its still severely undervalued  than upcoming Roblox and existing Draftking of the world.
12/10/20, 8:23 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You did well by selling Tesla
12/10/20, 8:23 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: We have seen a high
12/10/20, 8:23 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: For many months in my opinion
12/10/20, 8:24 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: For share yes but for 550 PUT option No
12/10/20, 8:24 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Did you buy or sell PUT?
12/10/20, 8:24 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: If you buy you are in great shape
12/10/20, 8:24 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Yesterday sold my PUT
12/10/20, 8:24 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bought*
12/10/20, 8:24 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bhai buy karna tha
12/10/20, 8:24 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: $600 ka put
12/10/20, 8:25 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You sold Tesla for a reason as you thought it will drop so why sell PUT?
12/10/20, 8:25 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: In fact it should be a buy PUT
12/10/20, 8:25 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Mera 550 ka PUT that which I bought when TESLA at 643. And sold yesterday
12/10/20, 8:26 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Oh got it
12/10/20, 8:26 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: I think from 600 Tesla will back to UP
12/10/20, 8:26 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You were trying to milk both ways 😜
12/10/20, 8:26 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Tesla game is over .. lot of negative commentary coming up
12/10/20, 8:27 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Same here, it was a gamble to wait for today... , but it was a gamble / thought high risk to wait for today, hence sold yesterday,
12/10/20, 8:28 AM - +1 (972) 754-6465: You mean Bulls and cow’s 🐄 😀
12/10/20, 8:28 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Anyone saw GLSI .. $5 ka stock goes up to $158
12/10/20, 8:29 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: And then goes to $57
12/10/20, 8:29 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Now $85
12/10/20, 8:29 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 👍
12/10/20, 8:29 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I didn’t do anything
12/10/20, 8:29 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Just saying how the market works
12/10/20, 8:30 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I got a news alert from MarketWatch and it was $15
12/10/20, 8:30 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: CRM at 219 . Good price to enter
12/10/20, 8:33 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: This is all bubble .. no rules no valuations. Another bad job report.. over 850k filed for unemployment benefits and market will go up! Go figure.
12/10/20, 8:34 AM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Today look market go more down or Green?
12/10/20, 8:34 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I am just saying in general
12/10/20, 8:34 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Doesn’t matter
12/10/20, 8:35 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: All stocks need to drop 30% at a minimum to be connected to reality
12/10/20, 8:35 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Uber Lyft all time high .. is anyone taking ride?
12/10/20, 8:36 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: On what basis they are all time high .. because all the people on planet will take ride in 2030
12/10/20, 8:36 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: There is a crazy madness
12/10/20, 8:36 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: 😅😅😛
12/10/20, 8:37 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Airline stocks are 50% of their high .. is air travel even 25% of the high?? These are the basic questions I have and not able to get a sense. How long we can keep thinking .. road looks good! Future is bright!!
12/10/20, 8:39 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: The Dow should be at 25k and S&P at 3k to be connected to any reality
12/10/20, 8:39 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Nasdaq at 9k
12/10/20, 8:39 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Otherwise it’s all bubble
12/10/20, 8:41 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Anyway have fun guys .. enjoy your day!
12/10/20, 9:10 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: https://youtu.be/WL5Z6fB9v_0
12/10/20, 9:11 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Indian Tesla Launch
12/10/20, 9:12 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: when there is unlimited money supply with near zero interest rate the valuations do not matter, bubble will likely get much bigger before bursting. so the options are to participate in bubble or watch from sideline
12/10/20, 9:17 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I agree. In the same way one can argue that bond market is a bubble with 0 to negative interest rate. The question comes to what other alternatives are there for investors to allocate capital. The market can remain overvalued for a very long time, unless there is a trigger which pops it. Case in point, the market rallied 900% after the from 80's to early 2000. The multiple were much more ridiculous then. At least we have earnings from solid companies today.
12/10/20, 9:17 AM - +1 (551) 580-3181: Just exited from TESLA
12/10/20, 9:18 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Another reference point for bubble.
12/10/20, 9:36 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I would say it is an opportunity to get in Tesla but not to exit
12/10/20, 9:38 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I agree... tsla will announce anytime now that they are done with the selling of shares worth 5bn, which is causing this dip. 
I did not sell any of mine did not add either as already heavily invested.
12/10/20, 9:39 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I would say that Tesla will go up. And it is a good guy
12/10/20, 9:39 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: If you have losses best is to stay there.
12/10/20, 9:44 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I bought some at $578
12/10/20, 9:44 AM - +1 (917) 375-5298: Correct looks like
12/10/20, 9:47 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Excellent price. Keep it
12/10/20, 10:27 AM - +1 (551) 580-3181: I am bad at making decision in TSLA
12/10/20, 10:30 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Sri there is no good or bad decision honestly. The market is so shaky
12/10/20, 10:31 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I the last few transactions were 

I purchased for 597, sold for 644. Purchased for 638, now waiting to go up 😃

So one good decision and one bad
12/10/20, 10:31 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: But the bad will become good once it goes up again. It won’t remain bad for long time.
12/10/20, 10:39 AM - +1 (551) 580-3181: 👍 thanks

12/10/20, 10:53 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: What’s up with CRWD ? It is up by 8%
12/10/20, 10:58 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Seems like they heard me highlighting the valuations difference with AI 😅
12/10/20, 11:14 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Again this group saved Tesla today
12/10/20, 11:14 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Back to green
12/10/20, 11:15 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 👍
12/10/20, 11:19 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Lol 😂

12/10/20, 11:35 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Tesla main puncture hona jaroori hai
12/10/20, 11:35 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It is time.
12/10/20, 11:36 AM - +1 (717) 385-7085: jab $300 tha tab bhi hum yahi soch rae they or jaate jaate $2500 chala gaya fir split hua 😆
12/10/20, 11:36 AM - +1 (717) 385-7085: $600 se $900 to 2-3 month me ho gaya tha
12/10/20, 11:36 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Abhi $3300 hai for a car company
12/10/20, 11:36 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: $3300 se $15000 nahi hoga
12/10/20, 11:36 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Jo hona tha ho gaya
12/10/20, 11:36 AM - +1 (717) 385-7085: SNOW ka bhi wahi hai humko $100 me bi expensive lag raha tha or aaj $400 pe jaa raha hai
12/10/20, 11:37 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Anyway that’s just me
12/10/20, 11:37 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Another good one at attractive price is LOAK spac that acquired Danimer scientific which produces plastic alternatives (bottles, straw) to the consumer food industry. This is ESG compliant company, that will see flows from ESG funds. They have contracts with Pepsi, Nestlé and other biggies for their consumer product. Pepsi is also a 6% investor in the company. The market is huge and consumer good companies are under severe pressure to use eco friendly products that will serve as a tailwind in years to come. Currently they have one factory that produced 2MM lbs of goods, expected to increase to 65Mm lbs by 2025 (30x increase, but to be taken with grain of salt). 

Anyways, folks should have this in their radar for longer term allocation outside tech. 

I got in at $10, today is above $14, but if they continue executing, this can be another multibagger in the making.
12/10/20, 11:37 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 🙏🙏🙏
12/10/20, 11:37 AM - +1 (717) 385-7085: aap nahi, hum sab ko yahi lagta hai
12/10/20, 11:37 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Agar koi ye soch raha hai ki ye $3300 se $15k jayega to 🙏🙏🙏
12/10/20, 11:38 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: $15k means $3k after split

12/10/20, 11:52 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: They need just one small two weeks bull cycle and it will be pushed over $300

12/10/20, 11:54 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 😜😜
12/10/20, 11:54 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Aaj hi puncture hoga
12/10/20, 11:55 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You will see $5XX
12/10/20, 11:55 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I think unemployment is at bottom and may be like that for a couple months. And then will start going up with no stoppage....So time is now to look for an opportunity. You may not get so many after March/Apr.
12/10/20, 11:57 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: They are doing so many other things besides car ride...they are evolving themselves as a technology company. And that’s where valuation is. Having said that there might be a pull back (more in uber than Lyft) before it starts going up again...but it’s not crazy.
12/10/20, 11:59 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: They were always a technology company. They don’t own cars like a traditional taxi company!
12/10/20, 12:00 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Chalo getting on a call
12/10/20, 12:00 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Have fun! Enjoy the great weather while it lasts!
12/10/20, 12:01 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Again you are ignoring the future and optimism. Airline will be last to rebound. Ones with domestic flights will rebound ahead of ones with international service....But some airlines are still available at 50% of their 52 week high. You will be ok as long as you can wait for over one year.
12/10/20, 12:02 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bhai aaj kyon paisa jyada doon main fir. Koi cheez jo $30 ki hai aaj ke hisaab se uska $50 kaise de doon. Can’t digest!
12/10/20, 12:02 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: That’s just me
12/10/20, 12:02 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I am sure there are many in boat!
12/10/20, 12:02 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: In my boat
12/10/20, 12:16 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: my take is that  - with near zero interest rate, the valuations can go as high as 100 multiples, many companies are cheap though they look expensive. the real test will come the day fed starts to raise interest rate. That I think will be the first prick in the bubble. However fed is not even thinking of thinking of thinking of raising rates.
12/10/20, 12:31 PM - +1 (201) 423-6408: At what price did you short or planning?

12/10/20, 12:54 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: AI- yesterday was looking expensive at 95.. today another 25% up
12/10/20, 12:57 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Was this note from today or yesterday?
12/10/20, 12:58 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Today note
12/10/20, 1:09 PM - +1 (732) 325-8310: ABNB IPO opens at $155 in few minutes
12/10/20, 1:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep remember position discussion if it falls lower to add more. Also as you know all my picks are longer term holds, so continue holding as long as I do to get the full benefit
12/10/20, 1:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Atleast they are growing at a massive rate. Today Abnb will list around $150, at close to $90 bn valuation. The company was struggling to get $30bn dollars and laid of 2500 people
12/10/20, 1:36 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its getting crazier out there
12/10/20, 1:36 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I will remain sane with all the madness going around

12/10/20, 4:07 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: A mere 3% up or down is not a “huge rally / sell off” as such.
Believe in company fundamentals.. my 2c
12/10/20, 4:10 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Is there one stock where Upkar said it will do well? No, he just likes to trash every stock. Irrespective of whether its inflated or not, overvalued or not, he knows anything about that stock or not.
12/10/20, 4:11 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Sirf timeless gyaan😁😁

12/10/20, 4:12 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 😜😜
12/10/20, 4:15 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: All stocks are your speciality man
12/10/20, 4:15 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: You were also saying sell NET when I asked even though you knew nothing about it. I hope nobody takes your jokes seriously, I don't.
12/10/20, 4:18 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 🙏🙏🙏
12/10/20, 4:18 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I must have said to take gains
12/10/20, 4:18 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I don’t know this stock
12/10/20, 4:18 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Exactly!
12/10/20, 4:19 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I believe in taking gains ..
12/10/20, 4:19 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Look at Amy.. he sold yesterday and bought again today
12/10/20, 4:20 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: At a lower price
12/10/20, 4:20 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 644 sell and I think bought again today
12/10/20, 4:22 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Nikunj, this was just a fun teasing with friends. Nothing to point out...however to your point it was -6% today and then ended with 4% up...10% swing.
12/10/20, 4:23 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Upkar we love you....you are a gem in this group 😀❤️
12/10/20, 4:23 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 🙏🙏🙏

12/10/20, 4:23 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: One should have a serious position in cloudfare IMO and I rate it over fastly
12/10/20, 4:30 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I agree and I have both. Very tiny position in Fastly (should have added more in 60s) and larger position in Cloudflare.
12/10/20, 4:31 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: 👌 👍
12/10/20, 4:36 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I am not sure if one can answer this .. when do you say the stock has hit the limit? Forget this year .. it was unprecedented and some stocks went up to 10 times. But in a normal year when do you say this is it! It can’t go up any more and if so isn’t it time to take profit? Why do people hate to take profit? NIO at $55 was profit written all over it but folks were giving me push back. I like Amy he took profit in Tesla and got back again at a lower level. Perfect thing!
12/10/20, 4:38 PM - +1 (732) 857-9973: I guess it depends on strategy that you follow ..some like book profit ..some wait for long term..but market this last quarter surprised me a lot ... especially tesla 😐
12/10/20, 4:39 PM - +1 (732) 857-9973: I book profit on tesla but due to overvaluation i book profit and akways scared to get in ..lol
12/10/20, 4:39 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Tesla is outlier
12/10/20, 4:40 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Tesla was a satta!
12/10/20, 4:40 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Let’s take any other normal stock
12/10/20, 4:40 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: When do you say this is it?
12/10/20, 4:40 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Time to book profit
12/10/20, 4:41 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: i wish there was a simple answer to that :)
12/10/20, 4:42 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Why would people hesitate to take profit in NIO when the $1.5 stock has gone up to $57
12/10/20, 4:42 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: How much higher can it go?
12/10/20, 4:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Anyway
12/10/20, 4:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Even analyst take profits
12/10/20, 4:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Kathy (Tesla bull) took profit in Tesla few weeks back
12/10/20, 4:43 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: @19175443061 aag tune lagai bhai, aake thoda paani daalo
12/10/20, 4:43 PM - +1 (732) 857-9973: After tesla split i was thinking same ..and ..its still up like anything
12/10/20, 4:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Tesla is a satta hua
12/10/20, 4:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bhai
12/10/20, 4:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Can you say it will go to 3k now?
12/10/20, 4:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: There is a limit to a stock value
12/10/20, 4:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Let’s treat Tesla as an exception
12/10/20, 4:45 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I can say with full confidence that Tesla will never ever reach $3k
12/10/20, 4:45 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: NEVER!!
12/10/20, 4:45 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: No matter what they do in future
12/10/20, 4:45 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It is not a $15k (pre split) stock!
12/10/20, 4:46 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: 😃😜 tum kyun aag mein ghus rahe ho jalne ke liye
12/10/20, 4:46 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: If it was so solid every institutional buyer would have put every penny in Tesla
12/10/20, 4:47 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: @15023383068 I have sold all my NIO at $21 then $48 and $51. Thought that would make you happy😊
12/10/20, 4:47 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: That’s awesome!
12/10/20, 4:47 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Good to add more at this price ?
12/10/20, 4:47 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: No one became poor by taking gains
12/10/20, 4:47 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Now you should buy again at $25
12/10/20, 4:47 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: And it will hit $25
12/10/20, 4:48 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Just give it a month or two
12/10/20, 4:48 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: All this vaccine bubble and nonsense will die soon!
12/10/20, 4:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yesterday when it was down 7%
12/10/20, 4:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 😉

12/10/20, 5:11 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: Nazar lag gya 😀
12/10/20, 5:13 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: NIO $25 jayega
12/10/20, 5:13 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s not a $250 stock
12/10/20, 5:15 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: @15023383068 here. I think I'll still buy if it goes under 40
12/10/20, 5:16 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: Upkar Bhai is May at his gf 😂
12/10/20, 5:16 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: Mad *
12/10/20, 5:16 PM - +1 (973) 405-0388: Rumour : Stock offering dillution announced , just like XPEV
12/10/20, 5:19 PM - +1 (973) 405-0388: Confirmed 60 million shares offering !
12/10/20, 5:19 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Saale Chinese Americans ka paisa choos rahe hain
12/10/20, 5:23 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: Li Auto also lost today’s gain
12/10/20, 5:24 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Chinese have no intention to build any great products. They are here in US market just to loot our money!
12/10/20, 5:24 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: LK dropped from $50 to $5 in two days
12/10/20, 5:25 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Soon NIO XPEV LI all go into gutters. All the pension managers that are adding Chinese stocks in their portfolio are playing with the life savings of Americans.
12/10/20, 5:26 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: They use Morgan Stanley’s of the world to issue shares. Ye sab ke sab kuch fees main apna imaan bech dete hain
12/10/20, 5:26 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: They should simply boycott Chinese offerings
12/10/20, 5:42 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: I agree China is fraud 👍
12/10/20, 5:46 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: We discussed this the other day that all companies are not the same. Taking a small subset or example (like LK) refers to selectivity bias in behavioral finance.
 
My portfolio which is allocated to Chinese stocks is up 75%, so far it seems like they are giving me money rather than looking it from me.  While only time will tell, I expect China to continue performing well over a very long time.
12/10/20, 5:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: *looting
12/10/20, 6:04 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Agree, just because of one fraud it is foolish to generalize the whole market. Just because od enron one cannot say all us companies are bad or just because of one yes bank ( second largest bank in mcap prior to the crash) it would not make entire banking sector in india a fraud. So invest where one sees value
12/10/20, 6:32 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: QCOM
12/10/20, 6:36 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: US fixed the loopholes via Sarbanes Oaxley rule! Cannot be said the same thing for Chinese companies. Chinese companies have no values. They cheat and steal IP in broad daylight!
12/10/20, 6:41 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: It’s good either if you can time the market or you are not playing for long term. As long as you don’t care when you sell anticipating buying again on a pull back but it does not pull back below your sell price.
12/10/20, 6:47 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: i personally will focus on the purpose of this group which in my opinion is to make money through investment/trading in stocks.... I don't have enough intelligence to decide who is stealing what and when...
12/10/20, 6:47 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 😂😂😂🙏🙏🙏
12/10/20, 6:47 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I like your focus!
12/10/20, 6:50 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: So coming to the point is NIO a buy now? 🤪🤪🤪
12/10/20, 6:52 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: I hold it from when it was $3 and will continue to hold as my target is $100+
12/10/20, 6:52 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Wow
12/10/20, 6:52 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: That’s amazing man!
12/10/20, 6:53 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: You know your gf better 😂😂
12/10/20, 6:54 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Serious question poocha bhai
12/10/20, 6:54 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: NIO lovers can tell me.
12/10/20, 6:54 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: 🤪 —this confused me 😀
12/10/20, 7:11 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Ye kab tak stock stock karenge kabhi fun bhi chahiye
12/10/20, 7:11 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Stock market depresses you
12/10/20, 7:30 PM - +1 (732) 983-7189: NIO will be more down tomorrow if I am not wrong .

12/11/20, 8:44 AM - +1 (646) 413-2283: We already had Skype before zoom. God knows why zoom is considered first one in video calls.
12/11/20, 8:46 AM - +1 (224) 422-2950: ‘ease of use’ and number of attendees are key factor. 
How zoom is different
12/11/20, 8:47 AM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Tomorrow if someone do better the. Zoom then they will be leader 😀
12/11/20, 9:00 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Skype is nowhere as good as Zoom. It might have improved now but it was a massive pain to use skype in the past. No wonder Microsoft themselves ditched skype and came up with Teams which is much better although still lagging behind zoom.
12/11/20, 9:04 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: When FB replaced Orkut everybody thought some other company will replace FB, hasnt happened till yet. So all depends how a company sustains and adapts.
12/11/20, 9:15 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Orkut never took off globally. It was mostly popular in India and Brazil. It was Myspace that facebook displaced.
12/11/20, 9:18 AM - +1 (646) 413-2283: I think it’s more to do with marketing than product. Orkut was as good as fb when fb came. Moreover orkut was not first. There were others before orkut. Same for apple also. Apple did not get first smartphone but marketed it well.
12/11/20, 9:24 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Thanks Kunal,  good to know. Never heard of myspace :)
12/11/20, 9:25 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Myspace and friendster were in many ways the first social media companies that achieved mass base
12/11/20, 9:25 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: 👍🏼
12/11/20, 9:39 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: CLSK
12/11/20, 9:48 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Others have responded but to summarize a) ease of use, no account or download b) cloud native and can scale seamlessly (if Skype has support 50 folks, zoom can do 1000) c) timing to the market in the midst of covid d) Marketing - Enrolling schools to Government to corporations, zoom is a preferred choice e) Vision - Integrating with enterprise application, launching hardware/phones to the company's infrastructure making it sticky, zoom app market place to let third party developers to build applications, Onzoom to buy and sell tickets of major events. 

All in all, Its changing the way business is conducted and will be conducted in the future.

12/11/20, 10:22 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Why Elon’s pic is next to all of them? Just to get free advertising 😂?
12/11/20, 10:22 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Stripe will be a blockbuster. The company that truly compete with Stripe and reasonably priced will be Adyen
12/11/20, 10:23 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Yeah Space-x is going to be huge.

12/11/20, 10:25 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I'll read abt Stripe then
12/11/20, 10:25 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Adyen up 40% in 2 months, but it will look significantly undervalued when stripe comes to the scene.
12/11/20, 10:25 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: keep on growing
12/11/20, 10:28 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
12/11/20, 10:29 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Little old, but relevant

12/11/20, 10:44 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: SEDG is almost 10% up
12/11/20, 10:47 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍
12/11/20, 10:48 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: good read..
12/11/20, 10:48 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I think enphase who is a competitor of sedg will likely outperform in the long run. I own both, though I have just started a position in enphase at $130
12/11/20, 10:52 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Nash- started a position- what % of portfolio wud you start with...
12/11/20, 10:53 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Symbol ?
12/11/20, 10:55 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Enph
12/11/20, 10:56 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Why Square is no where in the picture?
12/11/20, 10:57 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If you have 30 companies and each company is equal weight, its 3% allocation to each. However you many not want to build a full position on Day 1. So some people will take 1% or 2% and build if stock falls
12/11/20, 10:59 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: 👍👍
12/11/20, 11:02 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Square is more of a POS system than going into commerce. Adyen is a payment platform for companies and is much broader. Not only they will do e-commerce to companies selling worldwide, they will do  cross border remittance to retail POS to everything in between
12/11/20, 11:03 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its also European company vs Square US company
12/11/20, 11:03 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Yes stripe will be blockbuster. I first heard that name when Dhivya(cfo of GM) left GM and joined Stripe.

12/11/20, 11:07 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: This is good analysis, thanks. How about Wex? Wex is also in the same space.
12/11/20, 11:08 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Sorry I am not aware
12/11/20, 11:10 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: no worries
12/11/20, 11:18 AM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Do u limit the # of stocks in portfolio apart from weightage?
12/11/20, 11:22 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: They are into payment processing as well, but within US. Their cash app is also very popular. And they are getting into small business lending. Looks like cross border transactions is the key difference.
12/11/20, 11:32 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Is it ADYEY, for Adyen?
12/11/20, 11:33 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah Adyen as I said is much broader works in 150 countries with a mumber of payment processor and integrates all in one whereas square is US, majorly POS but venturing in payment processing and other lucrative areas
12/11/20, 11:33 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: ADYEY is correct
12/11/20, 11:36 AM - +1 (908) 672-5619: Any one following NH
12/11/20, 11:36 AM - +1 (732) 325-8310: Why QCOM going down > 7%
12/11/20, 11:36 AM - +1 (908) 672-5619: 100% up
12/11/20, 11:37 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Apple will use their own modem and not QCOM modem.
12/11/20, 11:38 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: This is known since Apple bought modem unit from Intel, so the price action on QCOM is an over reaction today.... it should bounce back when people have digested the latest news....
12/11/20, 11:39 AM - +1 (732) 325-8310: Thanks
12/11/20, 12:09 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Any news?

12/11/20, 12:51 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: BB down, any reasons ?
12/11/20, 12:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Updating this to 3400-3550, if S&P continues going down.
12/11/20, 1:29 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Not hearing from NIO or Tesla lovers today... all well guys?? 😜😜
12/11/20, 1:30 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Poking for fun

12/11/20, 1:30 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Are you milking it?
12/11/20, 1:31 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Salt ... you are putting salt on wound
12/11/20, 1:31 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Tesla had recovered after stock offerings NIO hasn’t
12/11/20, 1:31 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bhai mera ghaav main to puss ho Gaya gai
12/11/20, 1:31 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I have too many wounds
12/11/20, 1:31 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Waaayyyyyyyy tooooo many!!!
12/11/20, 1:32 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Can’t lose my life due to these wounds
12/11/20, 1:32 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Fun ke liye kuch to karna padega naa
12/11/20, 1:35 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I am like Ashwatthama ..living life with a permanent non curable “Ghav” I hope you have heard this story!
12/11/20, 1:37 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: All well Upkar bhai, TSLA will only hurt me when it goes less than 150, and in Nio, I have a very small position so doesn’t matter, however it’s still around my entry price, if it goes to initial 30s will add more, I still have very high conviction on both the stocks. Abhi wound nahi hua hai😜😜😜
12/11/20, 1:37 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: That’s awesome!
12/11/20, 1:39 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Have you heard the story of a king who used to turn everything into gold just by touching. Mine is opposite. I turn that into shit! I touch a stock and it goes down .. story of my life! 😂😂😂
12/11/20, 1:39 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: 🙁
12/11/20, 1:39 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Give me any great stock and I can turn it into shit!!
12/11/20, 1:39 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: When NIO bounces back from this fall, it’s time to buy on the first bounce.
12/11/20, 1:39 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Do us a favour ....Stay away from TSLA😜😜😜

12/11/20, 1:40 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I have been thinking of ruining all of your plans. I will just buy 1 stock.
12/11/20, 1:40 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 😂😂😂
12/11/20, 1:40 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: I was about to say opposite... since I want to enter Tesla
12/11/20, 1:40 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Enjoy
12/11/20, 1:40 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thats why I was thinking why CRM is going down. Sell kar do bhai🙂
12/11/20, 1:40 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍👍
12/11/20, 1:41 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Kal kar diya aur ghav aur le liye .. ab upar jayega

12/11/20, 1:42 PM - +1 (201) 456-7921: Downhill since yesterday’s close..
12/11/20, 1:42 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: On crm... point of view on why down and is it time to enter
12/11/20, 1:42 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Wait a minute..really...You had said that you were all in and now you took loss by selling all? And if so where did you employ the money?
12/11/20, 1:42 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Enter kar ko
12/11/20, 1:43 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You are great observer!! Aap bahut aage jaoge professional life main
12/11/20, 1:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Nahi bataoonga

12/11/20, 1:44 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Hope it’s not TSLA or NIO
12/11/20, 1:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Ha ha ha
12/11/20, 1:44 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 😂
12/11/20, 1:44 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Take a wild guess
12/11/20, 1:45 PM - +1 (201) 456-7921: 👌🏼
12/11/20, 1:45 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 🙏🏻
12/11/20, 1:45 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 😂🤣🤩😅😀🙂😂🤣
12/11/20, 1:47 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: All of this will not matter if I buy 1 stock of Tesla. It will turn into a penny stock!! Do you want me to try?
12/11/20, 1:48 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Snow is going down, is there any news? Would 300 be a good entry point this time?
12/11/20, 1:49 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: did I tell you to try 😊. Take your decision with your own risk....we are big investors of Tesla and want to see it at new high next year.
12/11/20, 1:49 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: why not. prove it
12/11/20, 1:49 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Ab rahne do bhai
12/11/20, 1:49 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Itne logon ka paisa laga hai
12/11/20, 1:50 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: aise kaise?
12/11/20, 1:50 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Let’s try
12/11/20, 1:50 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Buy 1 today
12/11/20, 1:50 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: mera bhi laga hai. both in product and the stock
12/11/20, 1:50 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Every time I bought Tesla it went down crazy!
12/11/20, 1:50 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Uske baad I gave up
12/11/20, 1:51 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: @Ravi, you also booked some profit in Snow rt? Are you planning to re-enter any time soon?
12/11/20, 1:51 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Tesla ke ghav to agle saat janam main bhi nahi bharenge
12/11/20, 1:51 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I like this approach. In fact love it
12/11/20, 1:52 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: oh ok....keep for long term....may be you are not getting correct entry point.
12/11/20, 1:52 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Anyway .. I stay away from Tesla.
12/11/20, 1:52 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I just do it to poke fun
12/11/20, 1:53 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Weekend fun now
12/11/20, 1:54 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Tesla is like BJP/Modi ji for us Upkar bhai 😃
12/11/20, 1:54 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: We all will go against you 😃😃
12/11/20, 1:55 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I won’t forget the day when musk smoked weed! Cost me $12k!!
12/11/20, 1:55 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I just stay away
12/11/20, 1:57 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I may have made $20K of Tesla in last 3 months. Partial recovery of my earlier years mess up. Just saying
12/11/20, 1:57 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I don’t even try my luck there
12/11/20, 1:57 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Too many scars!
12/11/20, 1:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
12/11/20, 1:58 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: You need to have strong heart to play with stocks. Else will be a loser because you will sell in panic. That may have happened. Not that it has not happened to me but I’m guessing your instinct
12/11/20, 2:02 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Yes I did book profit although I sold a day earlier else it would have been much more...For re-entry I will wait a bit more. Snow’s employees sell lock in period is getting over and my hunch is that it will correct more.
12/11/20, 2:02 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Dec 15th
12/11/20, 2:02 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash, I am up 23%+ on my position
12/11/20, 2:03 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Yep. And one more in Jan I believe.
12/11/20, 2:03 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep
12/11/20, 2:03 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks for sharing, I will also wait then.
12/11/20, 2:03 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍 up 19% for me
12/11/20, 2:04 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: It’s time to go for Friday beer Upkar bhai.
12/11/20, 2:05 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍
12/11/20, 2:05 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: <Media omitted>
12/11/20, 2:07 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Yep. Making me happy. Had a trust on this stock.
12/11/20, 2:07 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Good to enter now... or Diwali getting over for time being?
12/11/20, 2:09 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am seeing a breakout on this one though on low volumes
12/11/20, 2:09 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I started with a option (probably when you bought stock) and then sold option to book profit and bought stock...so I entered later than you at 39...so am in profit just today.
12/11/20, 2:09 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: 27% up!
12/11/20, 2:12 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I have my full position so won’t add anything for now. But per Nash it’s having a breakout today...So you may start a partial position and add more later.
12/11/20, 2:13 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It seems we all are on a money heist and Nash is the professor😜😜😜
12/11/20, 2:22 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Currently I am heavily invested in AT&T and Coca-Cola options...I have taken an extraordinary unusual bet (as per my standard) going over my option ceiling...And hoping that market does not crash...🤞🏻
12/11/20, 2:26 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Market is eagerly waiting for stimulus, let’s see when it comes , else the struggle might go on for a while
12/11/20, 2:38 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: if Stimulas does not come oday, most likely it will only come in new year
12/11/20, 2:46 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Haha. I did buy Fastly, Teladoc and INAQ based on @12015655130's solid research. But I may sell Fastly to increase position in Cloudflare or even NIO if it goes under $35
12/11/20, 2:46 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: What are the chances for today if you know...
12/11/20, 2:47 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Very unlikely now
12/11/20, 2:47 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: You're not alone. 😄
12/11/20, 2:47 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: is the house still in session? were they not to go into recess starting today
12/11/20, 2:48 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: that was for Stimulus*

12/11/20, 3:04 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Yeah. What happened suddenly?
12/11/20, 3:05 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Disney+ has 86 million subscribers, in 2020 vs 2024
12/11/20, 3:06 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Hmmm... Should hold for long term I think
12/11/20, 3:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 🙏So everyone knows, I have the smallest position in INAQ, because I want them to prove their execution. I mentioned other space the other day which are more high conviction
12/11/20, 3:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: SPAC

12/11/20, 4:03 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Wil it go up from here or come down? I think it will come hence short . Thoughts?
12/11/20, 4:34 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: SLS ki MC/BC ho gayi... 3rd lot of transaction started at $11 in loss. But I will hold for 1 week more before loss book.

12/15/20, 8:50 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: This is good idea though might not be fruitful for long term investors or people if they want to retrace the suggestions and their investing theories. Though in full support whatever works best for sanity of the group.
12/15/20, 8:53 PM - +1 (631) 429-6726: Agree, there are many messages whic people track or highlight their messages after weeks in many case, but also there are many messages not required/ refer later on. On this note leave this decision on group admin and members choice.
12/15/20, 8:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There are lot of my messages that I refer to either recommending new ideas, building on from a previous idea or referring to longer term prediction. It will not be idle for me if my messages are deleted. Any reason it matters if old messages are lying here?

12/17/20, 9:05 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I think it is time American markets see an extended bear market. It is not connected to the reality at all. How long can this go on? Job losses at 3 months high .. keep getting 800k+ losses every week and market is green! Too much greed I guess. This bubble is too much to digest! Markets are higher than pre pandemic levels. It should mean that we should have unemployment levels much below than beginning of the year! There should be a balance. Where are the bears?

12/17/20, 9:17 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: you are missing the point about fed - fed is much friendlier than pre-pandemic time, which I believe is the sole reason to drive this rally and this will only get much bigger.
12/17/20, 9:19 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Agree on Fed part. But what about valuations? Someday it has to connect to the reality. Every company can’t be this great!!
12/17/20, 9:20 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Anyway my quota is done
12/17/20, 9:20 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Have fun guys
12/17/20, 9:21 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: What is the basis for you to say the market is overvalued? when interest rate is near zero the traditional valuation methods do not work. the multiples can be as high as 100 times. traditionally the multiples were 14-17 levels...
12/17/20, 9:22 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You answered yourself. Is 100 vs 14-17 justified?
12/17/20, 9:23 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: it is with near zero interest rate... the day interest rate starts rising, this will change...
12/17/20, 9:24 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Do you think Dow will be back to 25k it fed starts raising interest rates? It won’t .. us time par kuch bahana banaya jayega. This is not connected to reality. Multiples at 100 are not sustainable and markets must crash!
12/17/20, 9:25 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: the current multiple is only around 35, and there is so much room to go up before it can become expensive
12/17/20, 9:26 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: This bear market of few weeks/months is not what was needed. Markets were overvalued and corona was just a reason. It would have dropped anyway!
12/17/20, 9:26 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: the interest rate rise will be the first pin to the bubble, but fed has committed to keeping it near zero until 2023... so enjoy the party until 2023
12/17/20, 9:26 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: We need to see a two year of bear market to make any sense out of it
12/17/20, 9:27 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: you are comparing bear markets of yester years when the interest rate used to be north of 5%... not happening anymore at these interest rates...
12/17/20, 9:27 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Just doesn’t make sense at all to me. But I am no expert anyway so will keep quiet now
12/17/20, 9:28 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: these are healthy discussions, no one is an expert, everyone has a view and we learn from each other....
12/17/20, 9:28 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Every stock doubles every six months. Some double in 2-3 weeks
12/17/20, 9:28 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: are you talking about penny stocks or the market (S&P)  ?
12/17/20, 9:29 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Can anyone make a sense out of it?
12/17/20, 9:29 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Regular bhai
12/17/20, 9:29 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Lot of regular stocks have gone 2-3 times this year
12/17/20, 9:29 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: And some may be more
12/17/20, 9:30 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: these must be high growth companies, supported by their sales... otherwise it will come down with the same speed as gone up...
12/17/20, 9:30 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Nothing makes sense these days
12/17/20, 9:30 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Anyway
12/17/20, 9:31 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Chalo back to work
12/17/20, 9:31 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 5 mins break is over

12/17/20, 10:08 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: it is reminding me time of 2017.....several analysts were predicting BTC to go beyond $100k - $200k.....ppl were jumping in crypto currencies....several new currencies were popping me market and going high n high....after few weeks all came sudden down....big big fall.....so careful with any investment in cryptocurrency.
12/17/20, 10:08 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Some news or another of such stocks where people just start going crazy
12/17/20, 10:09 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 104 percent up i
12/17/20, 10:10 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: one difference this year is that the current rally is lead by institutions and 2017 rally was lead by MOM-POP
12/17/20, 10:12 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: dekhte hai....hope that fall won't come this time.
12/17/20, 10:12 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: last rally was from 700$ to 20000$

the fall to 3700$ twice
12/17/20, 10:13 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: and rally was a year long

12/17/20, 11:47 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Question - Robinhood has option trading available?

12/17/20, 11:53 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Reaches*
12/17/20, 11:55 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: these are very risky ones, it may reach there
12/17/20, 12:05 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Yes

12/17/20, 12:18 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: My recommendation - Wish is crap
12/17/20, 12:19 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It’s a bubble company. It can go up but will burst one day. Chinese company selling products.
12/17/20, 12:20 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Short term day or two is ok but long term I think not good
12/17/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I don't think Wish is Chinese company...I used Wish app many time to order several household items.
12/17/20, 12:46 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: It is good as per me and can be a long term player.
12/17/20, 1:03 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: It is a Chinese company.
12/17/20, 1:07 PM - +1 (732) 325-8310: Hi Anand, It is a chines Company.
12/17/20, 1:08 PM - +1 (917) 406-2999: <Media omitted>
12/17/20, 1:09 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 👍🏻
12/17/20, 1:10 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Kindly ignore my comments on Wish. The parameter that I used for Wish, if I use it for Amazon, Amazon will be Chinese company as well

Wish sells almost all Chinese products and so does Amazon.
12/17/20, 1:10 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It’s the sad reality.
12/17/20, 1:12 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Zoom has been stable at around 400 for a month. What do the next few months look like for Zoom?
12/17/20, 1:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Contrary to popular opinion of overvaluation as a metrics of future stock underperformance as discussed in the morning, I have taken a position at The Very Good Food Company (VRYYF) which is a ridiculously expensive stock but has a few things working for it.

- It an emerging plant based food tech company based in Canada that competes with Beyond meat and Impossible burger of the world.

- Estimate market is $10bn today, which compares to global meat market of $500 bn (2% share). This is the fastest growing sector in the food industry and is expected to take market share from global meat industry due to one's own health and health of the planet. 

- Their current production capacity is 11,000 lbs per week, They have raised funds to increase capacity to 550,000 lbs per week (60x increase) in California, which will happen in the next few years (taken with grain of salt) 

- Current sales of $800k in Nov which is 600% increase from last year. 2021 sales estimate is around $10Mm which translates into P/S of roughly 50x (inline with some of my favorite expensive stock 😬) 

- They have a very active social media platform and people love their products . There is a wait time for some of their products. 

I dont take speculative positions, but the current market cycle (based on my EWT analyis) demands moderate risk taking. I was watching this from $3. It reached $7.5 and have retraced back to $5.7 today. I have taken a small position at $5.3, but will add on further declines.
12/17/20, 1:14 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: All the products I saw in wish look crap and 99% of them resemble popular branded products. Like $10 iwatch 😄
12/17/20, 1:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If someone orders from them, let me know how it tastes

12/17/20, 1:19 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Even the adverting looks deceiving. The pic show 256gb flash drive,2 of them for $5. Open the link, it no where specifies it’s 256gb or how many pieces you will get.
12/17/20, 1:21 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Exactly
12/17/20, 1:22 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Like a bunch of crooks behind the scenes. I would stay away from buying products from wish as well as stocks.
12/17/20, 1:22 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: By just product Company cannot be defined otherwise Apple will be Chinese company 😄
12/17/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (917) 406-2999: Yeah iPhones are assembled in China only 😂
12/17/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Is it an OTC stock ?
12/17/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Assemble? Bhai even production also.
12/17/20, 1:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Canadian stock exchange and OTC here
12/17/20, 1:24 PM - +1 (908) 672-5619: Wish can’t be apple
12/17/20, 1:25 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: 👍🏻
12/17/20, 1:26 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Bcoz apple stand now with current price. Anyway, I am nt comparing. It is for them who compare chinese products.
12/17/20, 1:26 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: How abt Dollar Tree in US?
12/17/20, 1:27 PM - +1 (908) 672-5619: It’s people’s perception about the market , it’s up to us how we take it .. wish may sell products of Chinese but operated from USA . They will close business if Chinese product trends goes down
12/17/20, 1:30 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: that is true for 70% retailers here, including WMT, AMZN
12/17/20, 1:30 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: kuch nahi hoga....I am using Wish from 3 years...
12/17/20, 1:30 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: correct
12/17/20, 1:31 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Wish has also good payment return system.....you won't loose money like you trust on Amazon while buying any product.
12/17/20, 1:31 PM - +1 (908) 672-5619: That’s called confidence..
12/17/20, 1:31 PM - +1 (908) 672-5619: That’s experience..
12/17/20, 1:32 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: One more thing I have seen in Wish is, it is not very good in electronic products but good in household items....
12/17/20, 1:38 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: How Wish is different from e-bay? Even there you can find such crap. I think same seller fees (10%).
12/17/20, 1:39 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I bought a nice looking led ceiling fixture on e-bay, perfect in every sense I wanted, for about 75$. It was advertised to last for 10 years. I thought its fix and forget.
12/17/20, 1:39 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: The product lasted for 4 months, and the seller is no longer to be found :(. Can t even return it.
12/17/20, 1:40 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Little similar fixture from Home Depot costed about $150. Both are from China, but in the 2nd case, HD stands behind the product, for about a year.
12/17/20, 1:41 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: What products you bought from Wish, @anand
12/17/20, 1:43 PM - +1 (732) 331-3713: IPhones are now made in India also... Check if your iPhone 12s are made in India😁😁
12/17/20, 1:43 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I didn't compare but e-bay I used on web browser and wish on mobile app....it is very good app for all products.....now from crap product, I don't know as I didn't have any experience.....cheap products cannot last long...the same experience I have with Dollar Tree products.
12/17/20, 1:45 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: E-Commerce has this issue....they don't have physical location like Home Depot or Walmart where you can reach physically, make a complain and return products.....Like Amazon, Wish also allow to return products in 30 days....there are several complains on Amazon products also.....I have experience as well as my neighbors and friends....check Wish app...I hope you will like....
12/17/20, 1:47 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Well I used Wish and so doesn't consider it as crap company....it was founded long back...Definitely not a pump n dump stock.....rest all take your own judgement to invest.
12/17/20, 1:50 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: *With 100 million active monthly users already, Wish aims to attract the next billion mobile e-commerce shoppers with a focus on affordability and lower-income customers*

12/17/20, 3:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep
12/17/20, 4:04 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I was busy today. This doesn’t change my view on Chinese stocks. It’s a fraud country in general. Starts with leadership at the top. If the Govt and Media cannot be trusted what makes us believe in their companies which are the puppet of their govt? Nash will call it behavioral finance or whatever term is out there. But at the end of the day their companies are just fraud!
12/17/20, 4:07 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: They are fraud!
12/17/20, 4:09 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s good that people are making money on Chinese stock but I will NEVER hold their stock!

12/17/20, 4:33 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍
12/17/20, 4:34 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 🙏
12/17/20, 4:54 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Bhai - whether cat is white or black as long as it catches mice, how really does it matter.  In the market be it any country stock, as long as it grows one’s wealth - how really does it matter?
12/17/20, 4:56 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I won’t get sleep knowing that I hold a Chinese stock because it could dip 50% overnight!
12/17/20, 4:57 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I just don’t have a faith in them no matter how attractive they look today.
12/17/20, 4:58 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Every country stock drops 50 or even 90 % overnight, there are 100s of example right here in as well
12/17/20, 4:58 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I am sure there are. But Chinese are not trustworthy.
12/17/20, 4:59 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It could be my bias too.
12/17/20, 4:59 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I am very well aware of it
12/17/20, 4:59 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: But I hate Chinese to the core! I can’t stand the country, their leadership and their companies too!
12/17/20, 5:00 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: I keep emotions out of Investing. But luck with your approach as long as it works, nothing matters
12/17/20, 5:01 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: good luck*
12/17/20, 5:02 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I agree it is definitely emotions. But I am happy to stay away from them. I may do day trade once in 6 months but I can’t hold overnight!
12/17/20, 5:06 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: By the way we were talking about multiples .. look at all the high fliers these days Fastly, Chwey, crwd, roku, cvna etc etc .. all have multiples in 100s and negative (some think these are high growth) ... how long can this last? Their stocks can’t keep growing higher while these companies lose money every quarter!! Roku is -400 . Has been in business for many years now. How long can one give them pass on profits?
12/17/20, 5:13 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Tesla will most likely touch 680 to 700$ by Monday, S&P inclusion means anywhere from $100B to 120B buying of Tesla and similar amount of selling of other stocks
12/17/20, 5:14 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: NIO will go up quite a lot too
12/17/20, 5:14 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Bhai, this week burnt my ass on tsla by looking at what analysts say, it's tricky
12/17/20, 5:15 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Don’t sell and burn your ass. Keep it and sell when it goes up.
12/17/20, 5:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: We have been talking the same thing over and over again. Lets summarize again - 

- Quality comes at a price, and winners will keep winning. We would have said the same for Amazon and Netflix throughout their life and what a missed opportunity that has been for people who did not participate.

- Fed and Govt had an inplied put on the market. The world is washed with liquidity and there is nowhere for money to go except stocks, and yes stocks are cheaper than bonds. 

- Until Fed start raising rates aggressively, the bull market is intact. You can offcoursr choose to sit on the sideline blaming valuation. But we are in a meltup. Market can remain overvalued for longer time than bears can remain solvent.
12/17/20, 5:34 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Fda panel endorses mrna corona vaccine for emergency use
12/17/20, 5:36 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: and stock tank 5% 🤣🤣🤣🤣
12/17/20, 5:36 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bears are important part of a market just like bulls. Fed by keeping interest rates zero is in turn favoring bulls. Market should decide on its own how and what levels it needs to reach! This is not a fair game!

12/17/20, 5:37 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 😔
12/17/20, 5:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Who says life is fair? It never was, it never will be. People who are flexible enough to adjust their portfolios by understanding longer term trends will nonetheless keep winning.
12/17/20, 5:59 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Thanks done. Will transfer money next time using this
12/17/20, 6:06 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Agreed. So can we influence Fed’s decision? Can we make them stop favoring bulls? No. So just pick which side you want to be 😄.
12/17/20, 6:07 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bear 😂😂😂
12/17/20, 6:07 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 😂🤪
12/17/20, 6:07 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Market needs to crash!
12/17/20, 6:08 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s free economy.. fed should not support any company
12/17/20, 6:08 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: If they die let them die
12/17/20, 6:08 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: If they can’t survive they didn’t deserve in first place
12/17/20, 6:09 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: No body should be handed out free checks either
12/17/20, 6:09 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Govt made a worst move by giving away trillions of $$ to corporations and public
12/17/20, 6:12 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: March was the time to figure out which  companies will survive and which won’t. Fed shouldn’t have bought stocks or given out cheap loans. If they needed to file for bankruptcy let them. Let it be a “pure” free market.
12/17/20, 6:13 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Faltu main free ka paisa bant kar hawa bhar di market main

12/17/20, 8:49 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Nice concept. I am loving their online and direct consumer reach capabilities . That’s where the value is. And that’s what will be a business model differentiator as compared to beyond meat and impossible.
12/17/20, 8:50 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thanks all. Booked 10% profit in a day and Sold today 🙂.

12/17/20, 8:55 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I doubt if there is any one out there that lets you trade stocks and etfs in HSA. The closest I found is Health Equity, which lets you invest in Vanguard funds. 
If you find anything that lets you trade stocks and etfs please let us know.
12/17/20, 8:56 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 😂

12/17/20, 9:13 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I mean most others offer all “unbranded” crappy high expense funds. Health Equity is the only one I found that offers quality cheaper Vanguard funds.
12/17/20, 9:14 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Upto 2023. Uske baad aapki sari baat manenge 🙂.  Tabtak enjoy the bubble.
12/17/20, 9:15 PM - +1 (201) 423-6408: Fidelity HSA ( net benefit) has a lot of funds compared to healthequity. I have both for now
12/17/20, 9:16 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Healthequity has all vanguard etf’s
12/17/20, 9:17 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Not sure on the growth
12/17/20, 9:17 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: mutual funds, not ETFs.
12/17/20, 9:18 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Any recommendations?
12/17/20, 9:18 PM - +1 (201) 423-6408: Thanks for the info. I will explore more .
12/17/20, 9:19 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: My account shows stocks mutual funds and retirement funds
12/17/20, 9:20 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Recommended is to hold detectables and invest rest
12/17/20, 9:20 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Depends on your policy
12/17/20, 9:21 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: @19174880032 please share your tsla strategy, I sold 10% today @657, planning to sell 30-40% tomorrow if it goes 700+
12/17/20, 9:21 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Today sold 10%
12/17/20, 9:22 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: If Govt would not have made this move...we all would been trading beer market....Spiral effect on economy would have sent country a decade behind.
12/17/20, 9:24 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Bhai TSLA batao, tomorrow is an important day, if our moves would be right we can make significant money from this stock
12/17/20, 9:24 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Interesting. Anyways thanks for the info. Will check it out.
12/17/20, 9:24 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 👍🏻 will check.

12/17/20, 9:25 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: You are the first person who has शिकायत on paisa double ho raha hai
12/17/20, 9:32 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: If you believe in diversified portfolio like some money in stocks/some in less risky instrument / some cash etc...I will keep my HSA in a less risky fund/balanced fund. Will not invest HSA in stock...That is my opinion. For that reason I never looked for that option but I have Huntington bank that allows investing in different fund if I remember correctly. Plz check though.
12/17/20, 9:36 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Well when I invested in this I knew it could be zero. Pure speculative position and had set up no expectation. That attitude helped me to wait more. I could have waited more until aar ya paar....There was one Pharma stock @ 84 cents I hold for over a year. Lost patience. Sold. Within a month their vaccine got approved and became $13 in one day....That was my lesson. 🙂
12/17/20, 9:37 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Folks who missed the boat are cribbing , who got on-boarded are happy, whoever put money in May/June are happy and rest are just cribbing about high P/E, S/E ratios.
I am Novice and have 2x+ in Sq and 4x+ in TSLA so it doesn’t matter who says what, it’s just they missed the boat.
I am not even mentioning the stocks like TTD, SHOP, FVRR, BYND which I entered on 10Nov. 
One thing I have understood is that, this is a market and one who finds a good stock and stay invested for 5-6 months get returns and one who wants to double the money in 2-3 days/weeks are screwed.
12/17/20, 9:39 PM - +1 (480) 252-1728: I wanted to invest small part of HSA fund in stocks, that’s too some long term safe stocks
12/17/20, 9:42 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Bad luck bro, but still you had courage to stay invested it’s just that you couldn’t stay invested long, but it’s learning I guess which helped you on luckin coffee
12/17/20, 9:42 PM - +1 (480) 252-1728: I found one provider named Lively which can be HSA custodian and they don’t charge any maintenance fee and they provide an option to link it with TD Ameritrade account which allow us to trade stock, etf.. etc
12/17/20, 9:42 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: TSLA me kya kar rahe ho?
12/17/20, 9:47 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Sorry @13652281847 was reading the message from the top...just reached here :). I am long on Tesla. Theoretically it should go up after being added to S&P. But also many fund managers would have started already adding to meet the requirements. And might not have waited for tomorrow. So don’t know the exact impact. But gut is that it should go up for few days after tomorrow. Then might be some pullback. Since we can’t time it I am leaving my stock in. Mine is 41% up as on today and can absorb some downwards.
12/17/20, 9:52 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Understood, thanks👍
12/17/20, 9:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I have said in the past, will say again. 

Most people who 
- Invest in high quality companies
- Invest for longer term 
- Don't trade in and out listening to financial media

Will likely do better than most day traders or even fund managers out there.
12/17/20, 9:55 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Very good find 👍🏻
12/17/20, 9:55 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Conceptually you invest in stock the fund you don’t need for sometime.  You can live without it which ultimately lets you control when to sell...With HSA that’s not the case. God willing you never need this. But medical need comes sudden....With that logic I don’t put my HSA in stock. If I want to take some risk then I will rather chose some fund and not direct stock...But again That is just me. Because I am a moderate risk taker.
12/17/20, 9:58 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: So true. 👌🏻👏
12/17/20, 10:01 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I do follow your stocks, one or two could be here n there  and have gained so far, long term investing is a boon for new investors like me, kuch karna hi nahi hai just put your money in your high conviction stocks, stay invested and let the CEOs work to grow our money, I don’t know why still so much of confusion 😜😜😜
12/17/20, 10:02 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Many times I believe financial media is just spending an hour on the screen just because they are paid for that. I have seen CNBC (many times same guy) having a quite opposite advice for the same stock within a couple of week. Palantir- Cramer gave a big thumbs down the day it listed...Now same CNBC is calling stock of the year 2021.
12/17/20, 10:04 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Loved it bro. You nailed it   ❤️😀🤩
12/17/20, 10:04 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Yup. That tells how much these talking heads know.
12/17/20, 10:05 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: In 2020, most of the fund managers have performed worst then retail/Robinhood investors and hence this cribbing across media that the market is too high etc.
We have performed better than wallstreet this year I guess and are capable of eating their jobs if we need to be 😎😎
12/17/20, 10:08 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: That’s because this time we (retail investors) got them..🙂We took the market control while they were waiting.
12/17/20, 10:10 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Look at their show - they will bring four heads and ask for a share - Trade or Fade...Two will say Trade and another two fade...Now you decide...They will be right either way.
12/17/20, 10:10 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍👍

12/17/20, 10:30 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I am on ETrade. Charge 3.95.
12/17/20, 10:31 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Schwab is best for OTC stocks. No charge. Even Merrill doesn’t charge anything but the app is painful.
12/17/20, 10:33 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: You have to use web, app doesn’t support OTC. Very weird but it is what it is.

12/17/20, 11:25 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Any input will be appreciated as I am planning to add for long term investment.
12/18/20, 2:58 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I believe it is very good. Have been tracking since it was $19. Unfortunately didn't buy any.

12/18/20, 8:58 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: 👍👍
12/18/20, 9:09 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ravi - I dont track it, but this looks interesting. For long term investment, here is the minimum that I think you should do

- Find the useful economic life of the mine. While they control 15% of the market, what is the proven and probable remaining reserves they have and how long will that last? This will determine the longevity with your investment

- How will they see future growth? Can they increase their production every year. I read something about 2022 phase expansion, but did not get details on what will be the capacity then? What happens in 2021?

- While they have strategic location in NA. Is the price cheaper elsewhere in Asia? What is stopping car companies to buy in bulk and source from elsewhere? Superior product, slippage, price advantage?
12/18/20, 9:14 AM - +1 (415) 662-3481: On top of all, is the life of mine not yet discounted in price?
12/18/20, 9:20 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: That's a tough question to ask, and depending your estimates of reserves, your realized price and your discount rate, you can get a wide variety if answers.  

Ravi doesn't need be an equity analyst and create a model, but simply estimate the long term growth rate to view if its investable. My view is market is so focus on next quarter or next year, that they miss the big picture compounding effect on a company that has long runway for growth.
12/18/20, 9:22 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: 👌🏻

12/18/20, 10:04 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep, I agree
12/18/20, 10:04 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: This is not healthy for stock market
12/18/20, 10:04 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Its good though amongst so many bulls we have a bear.
12/18/20, 10:04 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bears ko bhi action chahiye
12/18/20, 10:04 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Absolutely

12/18/20, 10:07 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s too much
12/18/20, 10:08 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bulls need to be controlled
12/18/20, 10:08 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Otherwise it’s continue to be a bubble
12/18/20, 10:09 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Need a continuous steady growth
12/18/20, 10:09 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Not a huge run like these for no reasons
12/18/20, 10:09 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Economy is in worst shape and market cannot keep painting a rosy picture
12/18/20, 10:10 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: These two need to align somewhere
12/18/20, 10:10 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Doing that Sirji, in phases, 10% yesterday at 657 and 10% today at 676..... next would be at 700 and beyond
12/18/20, 10:10 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Chalo done for the day
12/18/20, 10:10 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Main to kahta hoon poora nikal lo

12/18/20, 10:11 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Upkar bhai - your logic is correct. What is happening here is S&P is ingesting 100B in Tesla and Tesla will shoot up.
12/18/20, 10:11 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Anyway done for the day
12/18/20, 10:11 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bye

12/18/20, 10:12 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Nobody became poor by taking gains
12/18/20, 10:13 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Tesla will touch 700 soon
12/18/20, 10:13 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: The real show will be in the last trading hour or after market today, also I avoid buying /selling in one go
12/18/20, 10:13 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Gain le kar enjoy karo weekend

12/18/20, 10:28 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: A lot of companies will give you 10x return over next 10 yrs

12/18/20, 11:29 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am tracking it, but unable to buy it
12/18/20, 11:31 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Bhai log I am suggesting BIGC. Anything lower than $70 is a good price. I have made some money in the past at these levels. I missed to buy in last couple of days. Keep an eye on it
12/18/20, 11:32 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Hope Tesla folks made money
12/18/20, 11:33 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Very interesting 🤨. I read about this company last year. Don’t remember where I saw it. 700% YTD. Wow.
12/18/20, 11:34 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: UPST is keep on going up
12/18/20, 11:35 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Ok Nash , let us know when you think is a good entry point
12/18/20, 11:51 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: And we stopped someone going short on the basis of 52 week high. 🙂
12/18/20, 11:53 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: +1😀
12/18/20, 11:55 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Sometime do something for fun. Even if not healthy. Like you drink beer🙂
12/18/20, 11:57 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Even on Wednesdays.
12/18/20, 11:57 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I meant weekdays.
12/18/20, 11:58 AM - +1 (917) 406-2999: @12015655130, @17325013097 Jumia is 58% up, any suggestions If we can enter still..
12/18/20, 11:58 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Dancing for bulls profit 😀
12/18/20, 11:59 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: We concur with u. Except timing. Us after 2022 vs yours now.
12/18/20, 12:01 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Now u r making me think 🤔
12/18/20, 12:25 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: It is all time high. Not sure to enter now but good stock for long term.
I am also not yet entered in it. So, only suggestion to buy in chunks and can avg if go down until @12015655130 has any better suggestion.
12/18/20, 12:50 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I have a mixed feeling. The market is huge in Africa but there are infrastructure bottlenecks. The kind of price appreciation has not followed by equivalent growth in sales.  

If you are looking for emerging e-commerce play, Ozon (Russian market) is a much better value and growth play IMO
12/18/20, 1:24 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: this is more Exciting than watching the Super Bowl.. Let's go Tesla,... Let's go Tesla!!! Da Da Ta Ta Ta ....

12/18/20, 2:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Both are breaking out. Add on retracement, though I am not sure of major retracement if market continues bullish
12/18/20, 2:28 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: ok thanks Nash
12/18/20, 2:55 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Power hour, Tesla volume will be crazy.

12/18/20, 3:04 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I have a feeling it’s is heading down
12/18/20, 3:04 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 👎, yep it's down the barrel

12/18/20, 3:40 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Upkar stay away brother 🙏🏽
12/18/20, 3:40 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I have coined a term for this syndrome
12/18/20, 3:40 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s called DPS
12/18/20, 3:40 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Diminishing Profit Syndrome
12/18/20, 3:40 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Since you have seen $684 you won’t sell it when it starts dropping. Mine says it’s coming right back up but it doesn’t

12/18/20, 4:37 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: That’s too much to prey for!!

12/18/20, 4:39 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Dude it had to come back, the index funds had to add the stock today and there were rumours already that they gonna buy in last hour sometime

12/18/20, 4:40 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: To becha ya nahi
12/18/20, 4:40 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It seems few investors panicked as they dint see the buying coming in last hour and hence they sold, the index funds added in last 10mins.
12/18/20, 4:40 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Ya fir $800 ka intezaar hai?
12/18/20, 4:41 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Sold another 30% at 680

12/18/20, 4:53 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Once the news came out that S&P is buying, all started buying and it reached the roof
12/18/20, 4:54 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: If you see 2:35pm EST, 25 mins before the market close they intentionally did it

12/18/20, 4:58 PM - +1 (973) 405-0388: Great catch !!!
Sachin Bhai , Your analysis on volume movement on Tesla s power hour and subsequent price moves was very insightful. Prefect tracking and could be used as a case study for the next S&P inclusion.

12/18/20, 4:58 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Just learning, I spent 6 hours listening to several YouTubers yesterday on exact volume that S&P will buy and when they will buy
12/18/20, 5:02 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: There is a deficit of 12M volume for S&P people, they will buy on Monday. That will not help a lot as Tesla volume itself is 60M av or more
12/18/20, 5:04 PM - +1 (973) 405-0388: @all was anyone able to sell Tesla at $695 price ?
12/18/20, 5:04 PM - +1 (973) 405-0388: The order book kept freezing up on RH
12/18/20, 5:05 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It never happened per se.
12/18/20, 5:05 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It says it happened but it did not
12/18/20, 5:06 PM - +1 (973) 405-0388: So 680 or 685 was the highest?
12/18/20, 5:08 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I sold for 685
12/18/20, 5:08 PM - +1 (973) 405-0388: This was expected due to QUAD WITCHING. We need to remember it next time. Lots of dip buying opportunities !!
12/18/20, 5:10 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Anyone follows SUNRUN?

12/18/20, 8:32 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Folks in US, this is a new thing I learned today about 2020 taxes. This was never the case before per my knowledge. 

2020 actually has a special provision to encourage giving. Ordinarily, if you take the standard deduction rather than itemizing your deductions, then you don't get any additional tax break for making gifts to charity. However, this year only, lawmakers will allow taxpayers to claim a charitable deduction for up to $300 in gifts even if you don't itemize. At least currently, though, that special law goes away once 2021 begins, so take advantage of it while it lasts.

12/20/20, 6:16 PM - +1 (727) 248-1546: What kind of stocks will benefit from relief funds any idea?
12/20/20, 7:18 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I see retail one of them. Walmart/Target/Amazon/and may be Costco comes to my mind. Walmart has not moved much in the past month. This is the time.
12/20/20, 7:21 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Make sense. Dollar General may go up as the low end income guys significant using their newly found money

12/21/20, 8:39 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It seems Corona is spreading again. Few things don’t make sense - 

1) China contained this virus in 3 months while the entire world is still suffering after 9 months. 
2) It didn’t mutate in Wuhan while it is happening in UK and will probably happen in other parts of the world
3) It didn’t spread to other cities in China outside of wuhan while it has spread to every corner in the world.
4) Their economy is booming again while every country is plunging. 
5) They only had 3k deaths at the epicenter, just US has over 300k deaths!
12/21/20, 8:48 AM - +1 (669) 235-0477: Answer to all of this question is they never let any of their data come out.
12/21/20, 8:51 AM - +1 (717) 385-7085: I think we can sell few specific shares before  situation gets worse.
12/21/20, 8:52 AM - +1 (717) 385-7085: Like groupon, airbus, RCL etc
12/21/20, 8:56 AM - +1 (480) 252-1728: Buy ZM again, I sold last week in loss
12/21/20, 8:59 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I thinks that’s been my point all along. If they did not share the data around worst pandemic in our lifetime, how can they be trusted to share the “right”data around their businesses?

12/21/20, 1:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Again, I am happy that you are following your own instinct and doing what you think is reasonable, which is rare quality in and of itself. As long as you are happy with your decisions, nothing else should matter. 

If you think someone else is right, which is also a rare quality, feel free to jump to the other side of track.
12/21/20, 1:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I will take a look later today.

12/21/20, 1:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Be careful what you ask for. Once we have a multi year bear market, and it will surely happen in the future, it will be a tough time for moat people
12/21/20, 1:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Most

Did any one put money in Dependent Care FSA this year? Since everything was closed down, does anyone know how to still avail leftover amount?
12/21/20, 5:43 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: 👆🏼
Someone I know is asking this - anyone has any idea?
12/21/20, 5:50 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Isn’t that use it or lose it?
12/21/20, 5:50 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Yes
12/21/20, 5:50 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Ya but how can someone “use” it?
12/21/20, 5:50 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: You see —
12/21/20, 5:51 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: You will lose it
12/21/20, 5:51 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: US gov won’t allow ONLINE (zoom) classes reimbursed thru Flexible Spending Account, even when all form of education for this year has been fully online in the whole country.

On one hand senate wasted a month to approve a 600$ stimulus to just the low earning families and OTOH most of the thousands of dollars from many more millions of families will be forfeited in unclaimed afterschool expenses.
12/21/20, 5:51 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: And can use only for approved medical expenses
12/21/20, 5:51 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Only way i can think of is ask some friends and family (who didn’t use their FSA or HSA to pay for) if they have purchased any FSA eligible medicines over the counter. For E.g. Robitussin in FSA eligible. And you can use those receipts to claim the money from FSA.
12/21/20, 5:51 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: QS - 110 😂😂😂
12/21/20, 5:51 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I know. I’ve been in USA for quite a while; I know the general guidance that I already gave to that person. I was curious if there’s ways
12/21/20, 5:52 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: No. This is DEPENDEBT CARE FSA
12/21/20, 5:52 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Ah ok
12/21/20, 5:52 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Medical HSA is carried over year to year
12/21/20, 5:52 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Dependebt care FSA is only usable for afterschool and such very short list of eligible expenses
12/21/20, 5:52 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Can you pay someone
12/21/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Now there’s no school nor afterschool for white world/country entire year
12/21/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Yep
12/21/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Sala fraud ho jayega types
12/21/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You hired someone to pay for babysitting while you were WFH
12/21/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Is that counted towards FSA?
12/21/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Besides most day care guys surrendered licenses temporarily
12/21/20, 5:53 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Yes
12/21/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: And also for elderly
12/21/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: So pay someone
12/21/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: But who will give such receipt
12/21/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Do Indian jugaad 50-50
12/21/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 😜😜
12/21/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Ya that’s his plan B to be executed in the remaining 2 work days left in this year
12/21/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I am just kidding Bhai
12/21/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Hah I can telllll
12/21/20, 5:54 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I don’t know the legal aspects of it
12/21/20, 5:55 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Jugaad hi karna padega. I won’t tell him he’d already know this
12/21/20, 5:55 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: For me the freak part was zoom Classes not allowed. That’s all
12/21/20, 5:55 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Buy covid test kits 😜😜
12/21/20, 5:56 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: To me even white-house should entirely  go on zoom long time back - but that mania is entirely different nonsense altogether 😆😆
12/21/20, 5:56 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: And sell it in eBay
12/21/20, 5:56 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: 😜
12/21/20, 5:56 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Open daycare and vaccinate 500 kids 😁😁😁😁

12/21/20, 5:56 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Declare emergency in the neighborhood to do this - Sanjay Gandhi style
12/21/20, 5:57 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Bhai lok - that’s for your truly innovative ideas 🙏🏼🤦‍♂️
🤣
12/21/20, 5:57 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I m just thinking out of the box
12/21/20, 5:57 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You can open a company by paying $250

12/21/20, 5:58 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Just 250 can make you CEO of your own company
12/21/20, 6:01 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Wow this is actually useful in many contexts.. you guys rock
12/21/20, 6:11 PM - +1 (480) 252-1728: If it was not used until 12/31, you will lose it, i had similar situation, I discontinued my contribution middle of year and used whatever contributed by sending my son to pre school
12/21/20, 6:12 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Personally I did this exact same thing when I realized situation in June. Luckily my afterschool expense till March was enough to recoup my contri till June.
But my friend realized this in October and so he has more $ at stake
12/21/20, 6:23 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: I am in the same boat of losing $3k approx.
12/21/20, 6:31 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You could start donating
12/21/20, 6:32 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Rather than losing just enroll any zoom class today. Apply.
Then one of following will happen and all options are better than just sitting and losing -
- they refund
- u apply refund then cancel class in Jan
- u apply refund and enjoy class
12/21/20, 6:36 PM - +1 (917) 578-2068: This year IRS allowed to make changes due to covid. Your  employer should have notified you.
12/21/20, 6:36 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They have model of attracting the top real estate agent by offering a differentiated pay structure. The market split between agent and brokerage is 60:40, they do it 80:20. That along with cloud based platform has been typically beneficial this year. 

I think the chart is strong and can be bought upon retracement for trading. I an not sure of the moat though, that stopping other companies to employ this model, when they see top agents ditching them. This is a pure momentum play as long as it runs.
12/21/20, 7:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Peloton up 9% after the acquire a manufacturer to help them with production highlighted in last quarter results.
12/21/20, 7:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Up 55% in 1.5 mos, because we took a position when they were unreasonably down after their result last quarter. Hope folks have got in at the same time.
12/21/20, 7:18 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: 👍🏻

12/21/20, 7:50 PM - +1 (732) 762-4064: Do not know but I doubt it
12/21/20, 7:58 PM - +1 (224) 600-8667: If you can get hold of some authorized private day care provider, who is ready to give an undertaking that your kid was admitted to the day care, then that can be used as a proof to claim the dependent care amount. You might have to pay him the tax, if he will show in the income but at least you can get some money back and not loose all
12/21/20, 8:08 PM - +1 (917) 578-2068: I don’t think any one will do that during this covid time.
12/21/20, 8:21 PM - +1 (917) 584-6536: Claim for babysitting service is allowed, it has nothing to do with  parents being home in COVID situation. You can even pay to an individual for the service and claim the amount. Use the person’s SS# for the claim.
12/21/20, 8:55 PM - +1 (650) 240-6540: Cares bill extended the deadline to March 31st 2021 to use these funds.

12/22/20, 12:07 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I had 150 shares. Sold all but 25 @65 average. Seems a mistake. 😡plan was to add more below 40 but it never came down.
12/22/20, 12:10 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Today’s gyaan - Gain is a gain! No one became poorer by taking gains!
12/22/20, 12:11 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: There is always an opportunity in the market if you look closer. So don’t worry about paper gain which you couldn’t pocket!
12/22/20, 12:12 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: All Stocks retreat from the top. So you will get another opportunity
12/22/20, 12:14 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: There has been a different guideline for FSA this year because of COVID. IRS has allowed to change (add/reduce) the contribution even in the middle of the plan. Normally you decide your contribution limit at the beginning of the plan and can’t change....You should check with your HR and ask them to reduce if you believe u can’t use and it will lapse....Try this first.
12/22/20, 12:16 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Ya except this year. There is some flexibility because of IRS. Also companies generally has a carryover option upto $500 (if company opts to that clause when setting up the FSA). You can check on that.
12/22/20, 12:17 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: My kids are grown up. I don’t use it anymore. I was trying to advise someone
12/22/20, 12:19 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: There is a world of things that you can buy under FSA. 
https://fsastore.com/FSA-Eligibility-List.aspx
12/22/20, 12:22 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: FSA accounts are of 4 types friends..
There used to be just plain FSA many years ago..

Now there’s HCFSA, DCA, Individual Premium Reimbursement Account and Adoption Assistance Account.

Not all are alike.
12/22/20, 12:22 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: FSA store idea works only for HCFSA situation.
12/22/20, 12:24 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: This doesn’t work as well. The way at least some employers have implemented this (right or wrong) is by way of asking for a “qualifying life status change”. In that case you can only avail back last 30 days and stop future contributions
12/22/20, 12:24 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: This is right. You can avail for care to elderly also AND in both cases being WFH doesn’t matter
12/22/20, 12:25 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: It’s not so easy. And does not work this way...Be careful. Don’t play....Just to give you an example - if you do an LLC then you are paying to yourself and your LLC income gets added to your income. If you are going for a corporation then there are other compliance’s. So do your own research and do it right only if it genuinely going to help.
12/22/20, 12:26 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: This doesn’t work as well. Only the deadline to “filing for reimbursement” has been extended until mid March of next year… But this is the case in all the years… The “availing services” has to be done by 31st December still, which is the same as any other year.
12/22/20, 12:27 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: It is surprising that millions of families may be affected by this in 2020, up to 5000$ and it’s not in the news!

And some dinky 600$ relief package takes the senate one full month to pass - even when it only affects fewer families
12/22/20, 12:28 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: My plan is not to promote/support/recommend risky ways
12/22/20, 12:29 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: You’re right it’s hard.
The plan is to enroll and prepay for some 2021 online art classes and write off any pending amount
12/22/20, 12:29 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👍🏻
12/22/20, 12:29 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I think my friend found links to such classes from his neighbor
12/22/20, 12:30 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I really appreciate everyone’s effort and advices - you all rock :)
This is my most active (and lively) group 🙂
12/22/20, 12:32 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: There has been some flexibility to the rules becasue of COVId this year. You should check with your HR. They may have a solution for it.
12/22/20, 12:42 AM - +1 (650) 240-6540: Did you find any references on this? AFAIK deadline to file claims is always March 15.
12/22/20, 12:44 AM - +1 (650) 240-6540: This link of about health care FSA but similar rule may apply for dependent care FSA - https://www.wageworks.com/employees/support-center/support-and-faq/healthcare/healthcare-fsa/what-is-a-grace-period-how-do-i-know-if-i-have-a-grace-period-associated-with-my-healthcare-fsa/
12/22/20, 12:46 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: To file, yesssss

But for transactions it is always Dec 31.

.. you USE by December file by March cuz many people are lazy 😃
12/22/20, 12:46 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: So u have to buy your medicines, avail your daycare and nanny and all that by December 31
12/22/20, 12:46 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Then they give u 2.5 more months to collect all those receipts and upload
12/22/20, 12:47 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: U can’t avail “after” december
12/22/20, 12:48 AM - +1 (650) 240-6540: So does it mean there is no change this year?
12/22/20, 12:49 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: AFAIK yes. IRS so messed up with Trump taxes that they still did int get time to sort real billions in DCFSA

12/22/20, 12:59 AM - +1 (650) 240-6540: B. Health FSAs and Dependent Care Assistance Programs
Under the carryover rule, a § 125 cafeteria plan may permit the carryover of 
unused amounts remaining in a health FSA as of the end of a plan year to pay or 
reimburse a participant for medical care expenses incurred during the following plan 
year, subject to the carryover limit (currently $550). See Notice 2013-71, 2013-47 IRB 
532, and Notice 2020-33, 2020-22 IRB ___. Under the grace period rule, a § 125 
cafeteria plan may permit a participant to apply unused amounts (including amounts 
remaining in a health FSA or dependent care assistance program) at the end of a plan 
year to pay expenses incurred for those same qualified benefits during the period of up 
to two months and 15 days immediately following the end of the plan year.
12/22/20, 1:00 AM - +1 (650) 240-6540: I would check with DCRA administrator - HealthEquity / Wageworks etc for a confirmation.
12/22/20, 1:01 AM - +1 (650) 240-6540: This is IRS publication.
12/22/20, 1:10 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I also had read this but (1) it depends on employer and (2) still not finalized by IRS. (It’s only a Draft).
But the last line makes sense 2.5 months).
You’re right I’d check with DCRA admin
12/22/20, 1:10 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Good next step 👍🏼

12/22/20, 2:32 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I am letting it go, I guess i missed the boat, almost bought it at 27😫I don’t want to buy it at peak and than see it falling or consolidating for years, they will be in production in 2023, will evaluate then, I might be paying a premium but at least there would be lot of clarity.
@12015655130 - could you share your insight on QS please, it has 6Xed in couple of weeks time.
12/22/20, 2:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Few points 1) Investment by Volkswagen and Bill gates 2) Market love towards anything EV related 3) Apple coming to the scene, and it's possible they buy a competitor like QS. 

It's just miles away from production, so one can only handle this as a speculative position.
12/22/20, 2:40 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash, the price is too high for me for a speculative play, will avoid it for now.
12/22/20, 2:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep same here
12/22/20, 2:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Manufacturing in 2025 and any meaningful revenue in 2027-28 (to be taken with grain of salt). It's really a long road for company with $1bn balance sheet and $40bn in market cap to dip my toes
12/22/20, 2:50 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I read it to be 2023, if it’s 2025 and then real revenue generation in 2027-28 is too far, things can drastically by then. It might turn out to be another NKLA as well😜😜
12/22/20, 2:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not Nikola with Volkswagen and Bill gates, but far from one can reasonably estimate
12/22/20, 2:54 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yepp the joke was on NKLA😁
12/22/20, 3:11 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I have a feeling they will soon sell a part of their stocks and book some profit if not done already!
12/22/20, 3:12 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: or QS May raise $$
12/22/20, 3:14 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 45bn and Zero revenue
12/22/20, 3:14 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Go figure!
12/22/20, 3:20 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: <Media omitted>

12/22/20, 3:47 PM - +1 (917) 406-2999: SBE is all time high it seems, hold or sell ??
12/22/20, 3:51 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: I am holding it. With reverse merger of Chargepoint and whole EV space expanding, I see it going further up in long run.
12/22/20, 3:52 PM - +1 (917) 406-2999: Thank you 🙏 Aditya
12/22/20, 3:53 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: 👍
12/22/20, 3:53 PM - +1 (917) 406-2999: Jumia is unstoppable, wish I hadn’t sold it.
12/22/20, 3:54 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: what happened to ZM....no movement
12/22/20, 3:55 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: Thank you Biplab and Nash for your insight 🙏🏻
12/22/20, 3:55 PM - +1 (917) 406-2999: Zoom is struggling at 400 range continuously!!
12/22/20, 3:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am hoping it catches fire after another stellar numbers in Q4
12/22/20, 3:59 PM - +1 (917) 406-2999: BLNK is 🚀 today 30% up already
12/22/20, 4:08 PM - +1 (401) 556-8301: Should we wait on selling TMobile TMUS..?
12/22/20, 4:09 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I started with RIOT, but bought MARA as well.
12/22/20, 4:10 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: How to send a link to someone to join this group?
12/22/20, 4:10 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: 🙏
12/22/20, 4:10 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: group is full Indraneil bhai
12/22/20, 4:11 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: Okay thanks @17325013097 ji! Thanks much!
12/22/20, 4:14 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: 👌 👍
12/22/20, 4:14 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Do you think the whole EV space is like that, with few exceptions like Tesla? One can imagine charging stations like our current gas stations. How much profit they make? How big their valuations can be? Even batteries. One car can have only 1 or 2 batteries. Battery company can become 45Bn company?
12/22/20, 4:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah, the world is moving towards decarbonization, but how fast that happens is speculation. Investors have build in years of future revenue growth in today's price.
12/22/20, 4:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Which is why I avoid most EV stocks. 

Doesn't mean that there is no appreciation left. It means that it moving too quickly to support their numbers. Since nothing can go up in straight line forever, when they start moving south, they will move fast.

12/22/20, 4:44 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Same here. I didn’t enter a single EV stock after got burned in NKLA and NIO. TSLA is the only one I am holding.
12/22/20, 4:48 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Nio dint fall like NKLA, it’s holding well at the current levels and can breakout any moment now.... did you book losses in Nio?
12/22/20, 5:19 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: <Media omitted>
12/22/20, 5:20 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Yeah. That was last year. Bought at 12 and then some at 6, then sold everything at 3 😂. But no regrets.
12/22/20, 5:31 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Yeah this bothers me all the time. I really want to sell all my Tesla stocks and book profits. But every day it is reaching new heights. Some folks say it is technology company so the valuation justified. I don’t know that part but going with the flow 😂
12/22/20, 5:37 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: @Nash do you own Tesla? If yes, when you would sell?
12/22/20, 6:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I don't understand the numbers, so I don't own it.

I love their cars though :-)
12/22/20, 6:19 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 😂👍🏻
12/22/20, 6:21 PM - +1 (732) 397-9588: 👍👍👍

12/23/20, 10:00 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: any news on ZM? what is the reason for it to be down today? did not see any negative news
12/23/20, 10:01 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I guess it’s the stimulus for which whole market is down, not aware of any news specific to zoom, I added few more stocks
12/23/20, 10:02 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Added zoom & shop till now
12/23/20, 10:02 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: market is up, I see S&P up half percent

12/23/20, 10:23 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: If you are buying 100 or so no need to worry too much. If it is 1-2k I wouldn’t bet my money anymore on this stock.
12/23/20, 10:23 AM - +1 (401) 556-8301: Penny only like 2k ...don’t have much
12/23/20, 10:23 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Then go for it
12/23/20, 10:23 AM - +1 (401) 556-8301: Ok

12/23/20, 10:25 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: By the way I have to say this .. it is a $2500 stock! It was $90 not too long ago. It is on sale now
12/23/20, 10:25 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: 😜😜
12/23/20, 10:25 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: There are other good options, why do you want to put it on a business which doesn’t even have a product in the market and which faked its prototype?
12/23/20, 10:25 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Just kidding .. needed to have some fun this morning

12/23/20, 10:35 AM - +1 (401) 556-8301: WKHS ?
12/23/20, 10:35 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Tsla is zooming again
12/23/20, 10:37 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Entered 2.54
12/23/20, 10:38 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Hoping to touch 5 soon
12/23/20, 10:39 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: It’s went up too soon too fast...And then started coming down. Everyday. It’s like trying to catch a falling knife. I will not buy it. It’s craze seems over. Unless they prove it’s significantly better than Pfizer. Efficient or easy to transport etc...then only a chance... but in a month there will be more vaccines from other countries in the market and may be with better efficiency and no -80 degree transport requirements. Those will impact all Moderna prices negatively...Like Pfizer went down since it rolled out vaccine....For all that reason I will not touch Moderna now.
12/23/20, 10:39 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You are right. I will get out at price
12/23/20, 10:39 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: But it will take a while
12/23/20, 10:39 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: My price is 132
12/23/20, 10:40 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thats true. Don’t buy just because it has come down. There should be a pull factor that is missing with Nikola right now. All negative news.
12/23/20, 10:41 AM - +1 (401) 556-8301: Yeah cancelled it ..researching on WKHS now
12/23/20, 10:42 AM - +1 (401) 556-8301: Bought OCGN at 0.66 yesterday and just came out at 2.40 ..
12/23/20, 10:42 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Started with 2.09. My average 2.18.  🤞🏻
12/23/20, 10:44 AM - +1 (201) 565-7161: do not you think, it will go up a bit... once they get approval. it may be touch $10
12/23/20, 10:44 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah two choices as always. I always like to go with 2 as long as the market is favorable 1) Buy a depreciating asset that will see a significant decline in value guaranteed in a few years (Tesla Car) or 2) Some of the best companies out there that have a higher likelihood of outperforming in this bull run 🙏
12/23/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You need to see my message on the gyan .. 😜😜
12/23/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Good entry price. I would have waited becasue it has both news and upward momentum right now....I will keep it for a couple of days and sell if it starts coming down.
12/23/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (401) 556-8301: Ok
12/23/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Kya pata “Kal Ho Na Ho” ye “Zindgi Na Milegi Dobara”!!
12/23/20, 10:46 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ha ha

12/23/20, 10:47 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Live the life based on “Going concern” concept....Enjoy it. 🙂
12/23/20, 10:48 AM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Trust me. I used to be a saint .. practiced this gyaan for 5 years before covid hit me unnecessarily .. got influenced by others. Getting back to being saint again in 2021!!

12/23/20, 11:24 AM - +1 (401) 556-8301: I have seen Fisker cars website and it looks promising
12/23/20, 11:25 AM - +1 (401) 556-8301: Yes cancelled the limit buy ...not pursuing any more

12/23/20, 2:49 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Back in 2017-18 it was all weed stocks that were tearing the market apart!
12/23/20, 2:50 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: I was expecting our coke and Pepsi bottles to have weed by now!
12/23/20, 2:50 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: And may be in water bottles too!
12/23/20, 2:54 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Same here. Added both on Monday🙂

12/23/20, 3:30 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Its a bubble, I am dead scared
12/23/20, 3:32 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Baker Hughes 100+ year old company is 21B, new venture with C3 called C3 AI is 16B in 16 days :)
12/23/20, 3:32 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: 2nd year Computer Science interns are getting $40 to 97$/Hour internship
12/23/20, 3:33 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Lets understand the stages of bubble 1) Overvalued 2) Exhuberance 3) Euphoria.

Given the pain in some sectors and coming out of recession, I think we are in overvalued stage
12/23/20, 3:33 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: This will go on for some time
12/23/20, 3:36 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Agree Nash Bhai
12/23/20, 3:37 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: XL revenue forecast for first year is only 25M I think. I cannot believe it is 100% up 😃
12/23/20, 3:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Also c3 ai has a joint venture to boost oil production for the energy sector
12/23/20, 3:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: With baker hughes
12/23/20, 3:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They have other joint ventures in other sectors
12/23/20, 3:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah I saw that, 2022 is 75, so you are still trading 40 times 22 sales
12/23/20, 3:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Crazy. It is much better to be private investor where you can still get in when things are not at bubble stage
12/23/20, 3:41 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: My only suggestion is that we should consider booking profits on these speculative shares. Because when there will fall, these will fall unstoppable
12/23/20, 3:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Absolutely
12/23/20, 3:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: One can enjoy the ride as long as we are in this stage, but ensure to wear your seat belts
12/23/20, 3:43 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Yes
12/23/20, 3:44 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I would be very happy to make $200-$400 gain everyday and not be greedy.
12/23/20, 3:44 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Even if I make it for 10 days a month that’s good enough. That’s my personal target
12/23/20, 3:46 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: XL is 33 now. Just see in 2 hours. Major profit booking is possible
12/23/20, 3:48 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Mara is 20 percent down, good to enter now?
12/23/20, 3:49 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Absolutely
12/23/20, 3:49 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 👍
12/23/20, 3:49 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It’s very risky one bhai.
12/23/20, 3:51 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Ok
12/23/20, 4:06 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Folks OCGN volume is 900M 😃
12/23/20, 4:07 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: 🤩
12/23/20, 4:07 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: So say if someone with 500M purchased the share for a $1, he or she made 500M
12/23/20, 4:08 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: He is the market maker, so obvious😅
12/23/20, 4:08 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: A Jewish guy sitting somewhere in one of the Manhattan tower may have done it. Now will buy a Senator easy 😃
12/23/20, 4:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Technically yes, but if someone dump 500Mm shares, the price will crash, so they will do in stages
12/23/20, 4:11 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Basic question- how do we know volume is for buy or sell? How do we know out of 900m how much is Buy and sell?
12/23/20, 4:12 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: There are ways to do it in installments. 

I am trying to say that people in the game are very well prepared
12/23/20, 4:13 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Somewhere volume split details must be available. Traders sitting with machines must have access
12/23/20, 4:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Since every buy share has a sell share, so technically  both are same
12/23/20, 4:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It is just the buyer are willing to pay a higher price for each additional share
12/23/20, 4:15 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: On advanced systems like thinkorswim, you can see the volume on bid side and offer side. If bid side is more then more buyers, if offer side is more then more sellers
12/23/20, 4:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I think he is talking about shares traded
12/23/20, 4:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 900 mm
12/23/20, 4:16 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Interesting .. so when sell off happens .. stock price goes down .. but with the same theory .. if someone is selling and someone is buying at the same price then why price movement?
12/23/20, 4:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Someone wants to just get out
12/23/20, 4:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's bid offer
12/23/20, 4:17 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Ok
12/23/20, 4:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So you are desperate to get out, you are willing to accept a lower price, and if you have too many shares to offload, the price will crash
12/23/20, 4:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's all supply and demand
12/23/20, 4:18 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Got it
12/23/20, 4:20 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: 👍 👍
12/23/20, 4:24 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I will take $400 every day :).
12/23/20, 4:26 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Demand supply gap controls the price.
12/23/20, 4:35 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Finally someone is speaking my language!
12/23/20, 4:35 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You agreed buddy? 😜😜
12/23/20, 4:36 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: It’s a bubble!
12/23/20, 4:36 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Initial stage of a bubble
12/23/20, 4:36 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There is a difference
12/23/20, 4:36 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You are also speaking my language!
12/23/20, 4:37 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Isn’t it easy? Someone has to sell for people to buy... so 450mn sell and 450buy
12/23/20, 4:38 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: You need a discipline for this to happen! One mistake and it could wipe out the gain
12/23/20, 4:39 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: 🕉
12/23/20, 4:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>

12/23/20, 4:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Sometime its difficult to catch because market participants will initially have a disbelief that this is only a temporary drawdown because market only goes up. Market need to break key supports for that to happen, which means there will be some loss for everyone. As long as we protect ourselves for majority of the crash, we should be fine.

12/23/20, 10:50 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: He spoke against the Govt and paying the price! They first stopped the IPO against Ant and now going after him. Didn’t expect Jack Ma to be such stupid, he should have known that everything in China (including right to live) is controlled by Xi and Communist govt.
12/23/20, 10:50 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: IPO of Ant*
12/23/20, 10:57 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: We can say anything against the Govt here and still walk away with no action due to 1st amendment. Chinese will never know the meaning of Freedom of speech. It’s not even in their dictionary!
12/23/20, 11:00 PM - +1 (502) 338-3068: Unfair practices by Fed! They need to let bears take control of the bubble. Raise interest rates so that there is fun both ways!

12/24/20, 8:55 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Ratnesh Bhai, it has done well in last 1 month. I was reading yesterday about the December sale. I would stay out of it
12/24/20, 9:02 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: BABA 10% down
12/24/20, 9:03 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Anyone thinking to enter or just stay out of it?
12/24/20, 9:05 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It has landed in severe problem due to China govt coming out strongly
12/24/20, 9:05 AM - +1 (224) 422-2950: Staying out seems better
12/24/20, 9:07 AM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Ok. Yes, I read earlier comments as well and mostly it is recommended to stay out. But with this big drop, I was wondering if it could be good for long term. I will stay out. Thx 🙏🏻
12/24/20, 9:34 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Sorrento Therapeutics is working on new antibody therapeutics in the fight against Covid-19.
It won a $34 million contract from DARPA co-funded by JPEO to develop an intramuscular injection that delivers gene-encoded neutralizing antibodies against Covid-19 and its variant strains.
The company filed an investigational new drug application with the FDA for a Phase 1 clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of COVI-DROPS, antibody nose drops that it claims boosts immunity against Covid-19 by blocking the infection and spread of the virus.
12/24/20, 10:02 AM - +1 (201) 850-0875: BABA represents China on a global scale. If someone may provide insight to following questions.

Will the government really hurt BABA?

Has this happened to other Chinese companies in the past?

How long will this prob last? What would be the consequences?
12/24/20, 10:04 AM - +1 (609) 216-4502: BABA's monopoly probe will be done by their single party govt. Its basically to remind Ma, who is the boss :)
12/24/20, 10:05 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: BABA is the golden goose of china and the government cannot be foolish to kill the golden goose, the current investigation should have the short term impact on the baba stock price, but that does not impact profitability of the firm. Eventually they should come to a compromise and stock price should recover.
12/24/20, 10:06 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: as long as jack ma focuses on working for shareholders and not make political statements, they should be able to patch up with the regulators
12/24/20, 10:07 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: if he gets into a slug fest with regulators then it can be unpredictable
12/24/20, 10:08 AM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Be careful with ZM. Same pattern as BABA. some news will hit it soon
12/24/20, 10:08 AM - +1 (201) 850-0875: Thinking to take a small position but kind of unsure 🤔
12/24/20, 10:09 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: What’s the news with Zoom?
12/24/20, 10:09 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: what is common between baba and zoom ?
12/24/20, 10:13 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Right.
12/24/20, 10:14 AM - +1 (415) 662-3481: I meant chart pattern. ready to breakdown
12/24/20, 10:15 AM - +1 (201) 850-0875: Thanks.
12/24/20, 10:22 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: One of the companies that had conflict with China govt was Anbang insurance
12/24/20, 10:23 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: <Media omitted>
12/24/20, 10:23 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Owner sent to jail.. company liquidated... this was on wiki... of course being China never know what the story was
12/24/20, 10:24 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Hope folks are out of it, after my message on BABA. 

Like everyone else, I also think that Baba is attractively priced, but there is no need to fight the government, in a similar fashion we don't need to fight the fed. 

They are and will always be better opportunities other than Baba who can coexist with the Govt and move ahead.
12/24/20, 10:29 AM - +1 (408) 396-9658: Baba will come back soon . Seems like right time to take a call , after mar or April ...
12/24/20, 10:33 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's atleast going to 195-212 from where I sit.
12/24/20, 10:34 AM - +1 (408) 396-9658: Already 37 down
12/24/20, 10:34 AM - +1 (303) 569-6446: Is Zoom a good buy?
12/24/20, 10:35 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There is a risk to Zoon chart as mentioned by Madhu
12/24/20, 10:36 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Let it bottom  and reverse
12/24/20, 10:36 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: No harm buying $10-20 higher
12/24/20, 10:39 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Is it a short term or long term risk ?
12/24/20, 10:41 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Just stating another rule that one can apply  consistently to make good money - 

You don't need to be first person to the party (aka bottom fishing in technical analysis for Zoon and for Baba), you only need to arrive when everyone is having a good time. 

The risk is that you miss the initial 5-10%, but you will be able to capture a large portion of the upside, if you catch it early.
12/24/20, 10:42 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Still a long term hold for me
12/24/20, 10:42 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: 👌 👌 👌
12/24/20, 10:42 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Awesome 👍
12/24/20, 10:44 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Looks like PDD is the inverse index of BABA 😆
12/24/20, 10:44 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I told ya :-)
12/24/20, 10:45 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 🙂

12/24/20, 10:47 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: BIOL is about 25% up and earlier in day went to 50% up from yday close... any point of view on this stock
12/24/20, 10:51 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Nice, i split into Baba and pdd should have done pdd only ;)

12/24/20, 10:58 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: One of worst predictors of all times.
12/24/20, 10:58 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: He is an economist, should continue only doing what he knows, rather than asset price prediction
12/24/20, 10:59 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍👍.... is it too late now to enter?
12/24/20, 10:59 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Anyways, all bubble will burst including bitcoin
12/24/20, 10:59 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The question is when
12/24/20, 11:00 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There is resistance at $163
12/24/20, 11:00 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If we cross that, it's blue sky
12/24/20, 11:00 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: for it to fly
12/24/20, 11:00 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Otherwise buy when a down day

12/25/20, 12:29 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: There are hundreds of models the brokers run every day to catch similar fraud. And they continuously enhance the list of checks. I learned when I was working at a bank.
12/25/20, 12:30 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: So it’s always good to be on the right side of the law.
12/25/20, 12:31 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: yeah....infact in Fidelity they attach wash sale sign with the stock which I buy and sale within 30 days
12/25/20, 12:31 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Also feels good that you have contributed your share to the tax pool :)
12/25/20, 12:56 PM - +1 (401) 441-1396: fidelity Statement summary already have wash sale entry ....so , actually nothing to specify explicitly during tax file ...Turbo tax or agent both aware , they take care automatically !!
12/25/20, 1:02 PM - +1 (732) 762-2128: It isnt clear if  you can not take a loss for that year’s taxes or you can take that loss the next year.
12/25/20, 1:09 PM - +1 (732) 762-2128: If someone can pl throw some light 🙏
12/25/20, 1:09 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: You can take the losses for that year. But you can’t buy the same stock again with in 30 days of the sale.
12/25/20, 1:44 PM - +1 (732) 762-2128: Please dont laugh but i went through this experience. I sold a stock at a loss and then bought it again within 30 days. Finally i took a loss on the next trade also. The first loss is tagged as a wash sale. But since i lost money in the second trade also do i get to take a tax break on the combined loss ?
12/25/20, 1:55 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: You should be able to claim the loss only for the second sale since the first loss would have been added to cost basis due to wash sale for second buy
12/25/20, 2:10 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: eventually u would be claiming loss of both trades
12/25/20, 2:11 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: Your loss from first trade is already priced in on ur second purchase as cost basis like Manik mentioned
12/25/20, 2:12 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: So your loss from second loss comprises both loss when you sold second lot
12/25/20, 2:12 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: Now do not buy that same in next 30 day 😜😊
12/25/20, 2:12 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: Else it keeps carrying in 2021 n u wont be able to claim in 2020
12/25/20, 2:13 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: Considering you did trade both time in same account.. else u/cpa will need to do extra work / math
12/25/20, 2:17 PM - +1 (732) 762-2128: Will have to check on this one. Thank you for the info !

Do you think Monday will be more pullback when volume gets bigger? I am asking as I am thinking of starting a small position...I have been completely out of cryptocurrency and it difficult to ignore now...FYI though I have positions in GBTC and RIOT with significant gains already.

12/28/20, 10:15 AM - +1 (201) 850-0875: It's a high risk - reward situation. 5% holding is with Atlaba, Blackrock and T. Rowe. Ohio Teachers Pension fund also bought BABA so this gives me a sense of confidence.

12/28/20, 3:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: After LOAK and Skillz added another SPAC today "Triterras" which is one of a kind trading platform operating in international trade finance space. The company's platform operate on Ethereum block chain and charge 0.3% to let buyers and sellers transact and 1.3% to allow them to borrow from lenders online. The TAM is huge, and blockchain based platform reduces a lot of inefficiencies. The company is profitable and have one of the best net income margin that I have seen. The valuation is very cheap and I am expecting it to generate very attractive returns next year. I bought an initial position today at 13.75 and will add more if it falls. 

Risk: There was a short report on the company which suggests one of its largest customer is in trouble. Similar to Fastly, the stock fell 30% when that happen, but had recovered given the reliance on that customer is declining every year and the receivable amount is small.
12/28/20, 3:39 PM - +1 (732) 208-1574: Ohh ok

12/29/20, 11:09 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Just to clarify for everyone's benefit - The short position is an implied allegation of fraud against the company, which is not uncommon for high flying companies. 

I did not find the allegation serious enough to deter me from investing. However this turns out to be true, I will run miles away and not look back. In the meantime, I am ok allocating the higher risk component of my portfolio to not miss out on opportunities like this.

12/30/20, 1:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Or break of downward sloping triangle
12/30/20, 1:54 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Zoom was one of the most expensive stock, with this decline the multiple have fallen below other companies that do not have a growth trajectory as this (offcourse because of reopening story). When this breaks up (hoping this to be soon), this should do really well
12/30/20, 1:56 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yepp, that’s why want to increase my position to gain more😁, please keep me posted once you add more of it.

12/30/20, 2:09 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Meanwhile TSLA crawling to 700, not sure why fund managers are not booking profits on this one, it has stabilised a lot post S&P 500 inclusion, doesn’t look to be the same volatile stock anymore.
12/30/20, 3:51 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: hope you exit. It is much down now.

12/30/20, 11:15 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: IMO there will be a deep red but I see that as a buying opportunity. Later one market will go up again. Biden with clean power will not be bad and will increase spending that will be good for market.
12/30/20, 11:19 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Plz announce the day you buy. I will like to average as well.

1/1/21, 6:47 PM - +1 (972) 989-0421: I think the group is at the limit, can’t add any more new members.
1/1/21, 6:48 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Wish you and yours a very happy new year 2021. May the new year bless you with health, wealth, and
happiness.
1/1/21, 6:48 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Ok will wait then
1/1/21, 6:49 PM - +1 (972) 989-0421: May be admin can think of moving the group to telegram.. which has no such limit... just throwing an idea.
1/1/21, 7:18 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Telegram is a great app but won’t be effective like this
1/1/21, 7:23 PM - +1 (419) 215-2329: Telegram is good app. Allows upto 2 lacs members,  history will be there for new members,  poll etc.,
1/1/21, 7:24 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Kindly open and share link. Folks can join. Meanwhile we continue here
1/1/21, 7:34 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I would say no. Let me send details and I'll ask you all.
1/1/21, 7:42 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I can see time to time telegram app suggestion comes. Here are my few observation. Please let me know how much you guys agree.
1) All 257 people in this group are not active. I don't see even 50% people are active.
2) I know some of known friends/colleagues who are just sitting here and not sharing anything. 
If we will have all 257 people active then it make sense to expand the group.
3) Telegram app is not used by several people. I have experience of one group (USA IT Techie) which became full in whatsapp. When I shifted to telegram then hardly 30% people shifted. Now that telegram group has not even 200 members.
4) Telegram app doesn't show mobile number. It would be hard to see who is joining from which country. 
I want opinion from all of you, if it is secure to discuss financial stuff with any unknown people in the group. 

If you guys still feel that we need telegram then I can do a poll and get opinion from all.
1/1/21, 7:50 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: If the referral guy is good to become active in this group then I'll try to swap with a silent listener.
If you agree then DM his/her contact details.
1/1/21, 7:53 PM - Lalmani BJANA: I also agree with most points.
1/1/21, 7:53 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: I remember reading somewhere that whatsapp group itself can be increased to 3k members... might be wrong
1/1/21, 7:55 PM - +1 (917) 406-2999: I would stick here and vote for WhatsApp
1/1/21, 7:56 PM - +1 (908) 672-5619: Completely agree anand ..

1/1/21, 7:58 PM - +1 (757) 285-8122: Makes sense to me. Concentrated group is much stronger.
1/1/21, 7:58 PM - +1 (408) 466-7693: I prefer whatsapp but open to both
1/1/21, 7:59 PM - +1 (917) 375-5298: WhatsApp is better
1/1/21, 8:00 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: I am open for both the options

1/1/21, 8:05 PM - +1 (408) 396-9658: I would like to stick in WhatsApp, I mean voted for this app. Very convenient, in terms of security it is good as u can identify people ... but again it’s upto all ..
1/1/21, 8:08 PM - +1 (203) 482-3111: WhatsApp 👍
1/1/21, 8:10 PM - +1 (201) 423-6408: WhatsApp is convenient. We still have members without name & DP 😊
1/1/21, 8:12 PM - +1 (609) 442-9779: WhatsApp 👍
1/1/21, 8:16 PM - +1 (732) 857-9973: IMHO telegram...just only for one reason more ppl shall  benefit from this active extraordinary group 🙏🏻
1/1/21, 8:19 PM - +1 (201) 208-1249: WhatsApp. I think we have a very good where we are able to control the type of discussions. It will be very tough to monitor when this group become large.
1/1/21, 8:19 PM - +1 (732) 325-8310: Hi Anand, most of them comfortable with whatsapp. Whatsapp is better and secure. switching to new app require more admin and maintenance work.

1/1/21, 8:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There are lot of folks with IT background in this group. There should be a way to increase the size. Google has few ways, which I tried but was unable to do it. 

It would be great if someone can figure this out.
1/1/21, 8:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I have a few friends who want to join but are always struggling given the size restriction, which is frustrating. 

IMO, bigger is better because we don't know if we get someone really good that may benefit everyone.
1/1/21, 8:45 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: looks like need android device and admin rights

1/1/21, 9:44 PM - +1 (480) 252-1728: There is no harm in trying telegram, keep WhatsApp group active at the same time

1/1/21, 10:07 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: First option doesn't work and 2nd option is using another app integrating with whatsapp which is again data security issue and may be illegal for whastapp.

I also recommend 1 person per family like if husband and wife both are here then lets have one only here and another can leave.
1/1/21, 10:16 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Do you believe in MARA ? For the next 3 months, 90 pc probability to hold a price between 16.8 and 38. Right now howering around 10.5
1/1/21, 10:18 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: wow....btw where did you get this number?
1/1/21, 10:19 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: I just happened to see on google results and other groups who are connected to few traders also expressed the same, the numbering may not be the same, but in similar lines
1/1/21, 10:21 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: this is super news...thnx
1/1/21, 10:25 PM - +1 (630) 414-8589: My son use discord for Minecraft and some school related project activities,  seems its time for me to take some lessons from him, will get back to the group.

1/1/21, 10:27 PM - +1 (551) 580-3181: Whatsapp, but would like to hear more options
1/2/21, 7:29 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: It’s tied to BTC, so if BTC keeps moving up, mara amd riot will move along

mara
riot
cannon
ebon 

all ate blockchain or mining related stocks

Also, mara has plans to deploy plenty of mining’s in Q2 of 2021 which will bring mining cost per BTC under 4000 which will increase MARAs profits

As BTC, these r very speculative
1/2/21, 7:30 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: cleanspark to add

1/2/21, 4:58 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: So far based on my research, RIOT is better than MARA. Unless you want to have exposure to all of these stocks, its better to increase the position in RIOT.
1/2/21, 4:58 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: <Media omitted>
1/2/21, 4:59 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Source:  https://bitcointreasuries.org/
1/2/21, 5:00 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Also, RIOT has more powerful machines than MARA. So they can mine fast. As the quantity is limited, faster is the winner.
1/2/21, 5:02 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: The biggest difference between MARA and RIOT is the number of assets they produce on average. $RIOT already mines more than $MARA, and they plan to increase their output even further. $MARA, on the other hand, is focused on reducing their costs and improving upon their energy efficiency.
1/2/21, 5:02 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: Going forward energy efficiency is going to be key in mining

using green energy
1/2/21, 5:04 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: cost of mining per BTC is going to be key as that defines profitability

1/3/21, 12:52 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Why should it stop? Just enjoy the ride if you are in. If not, get on board on the next pullback
1/3/21, 12:53 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Eth looks more promising in my opinion at current price point
1/3/21, 1:01 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Missed it inspite of you guys strongly recommending. I have started building up. Hope that there will be a pull back.
1/3/21, 3:14 AM - +1 (972) 693-4283: When it was 20,000 in 2017 we thought it will not come back. But it did came till 3500. Very uncertain 🤨
1/3/21, 8:43 AM - +1 (917) 862-4382: In 2017 the acceptance of Crypto was not there govt and financial system were against it. This time it is not like 2017. There will be pull backs on the way but it will not fall like it did last time.

1/3/21, 9:54 AM - +1 (860) 986-8967: NIO Inc. Provides December, Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Delivery Update

Company Achieved New Records for Monthly and Quarterly Deliveries; Annual Delivery Reached 43,728 Vehicles in 2020
NIO delivered 7,007 vehicles in December 2020, increasing by 121.0% year-over-year

Cumulative deliveries of ES8, ES6 and EC6 as of December 31, 2020 reached 75,641
1/3/21, 10:42 AM - +1 (973) 405-0388: Could be an options level upgrade issue. You might have to upgrade to sell calls or spreads
1/3/21, 10:43 AM - +1 (732) 762-2128: Seems like you are not selling a covered call or a diagnol. I think you will need margin for that and level 4.
1/3/21, 10:44 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Everything that goes up parabolic comes down with a crash. It will also happen this time "When" this tops. The million dollar question is to figure out When?
1/3/21, 11:09 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: I tried but not getting upgraded .. what are the criteria?
1/3/21, 11:09 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: How do i find which level i’m in TOS
1/3/21, 12:03 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: 👍
1/3/21, 12:37 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: Agree Nash to your point but I want to explain that this time the rise is different from 2017 one. Where there was lack of support from the financial and government system of the world. But this time it is there to exist for a little while and there will not be a crash like it happened in 2017. I might be wrong. We have very little to support the future at this point.
1/3/21, 12:38 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: At certain price point buying btc will become unsustainable.
1/3/21, 12:38 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Such parabolic rises are not good.
1/3/21, 12:39 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Steep rises result in steep crashes.
1/3/21, 12:39 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Then investors get impression that asset has no value and it's just a speculation
1/3/21, 12:40 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It's ideal if price tracks user adoption.
1/3/21, 12:40 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: What is different this time?
1/3/21, 12:41 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: More institutional adoption and lower mining rewards.
1/3/21, 12:41 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I expect btc to be $70k by end of the year 2021.
1/3/21, 12:41 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: But I don't want that to happen in next 2-3 weeks.
1/3/21, 12:42 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: Market adoption is also more now with ETF mining companies ipo.
1/3/21, 12:43 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Yes, I agree. It is probably 5x more compared to 2017.
1/3/21, 12:43 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Mining rewards have halved.
1/3/21, 12:43 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: So price target of $70k.
1/3/21, 12:43 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: Yes and as time goes it will reduce more
1/3/21, 12:44 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: My target 70k should come later this year.
1/3/21, 12:44 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: In 2016, my target was $7k. Instead it went to $19k, crashed to $3.2k,, the averaged around $7k
1/3/21, 12:44 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I hope we don't see same pattern this time
1/3/21, 12:44 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: I don’t see that pattern this time .
1/3/21, 12:45 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: In that case; is there another crypto that is a better buying right now viz. ETH LTC or any other variant?
1/3/21, 12:45 PM - +1 (732) 762-2128: Its under account settings. You can also request from there.
1/3/21, 12:45 PM - +1 (401) 556-8301: According to this ...just believe in TESLA is the gist right ..? SOLO, QS, NIO sab girega ...types right
1/3/21, 12:46 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: if BTC goes up, all will go up
1/3/21, 12:48 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Eth will go to $1200.
1/3/21, 12:48 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: That said ethereum has very flimsy use cases.
1/3/21, 12:49 PM - +1 (602) 451-9207: <Media omitted>
1/3/21, 12:49 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It looks very exciting to software engineers with it's claims of being decentralized compute engine for smart contracts.
1/3/21, 12:49 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: ETH at 970 already, i doubt 1200, i guess much more
1/3/21, 12:50 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: ETH ATH is 1400
1/3/21, 12:50 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: However, since 2016 we haven't seen single decentralized app,  get any traction or user adoption .
1/3/21, 12:50 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: I am also accumulating XLM,ETC,FIL. Had XRP but converted to BTC last week. There is no such study for the coins. It is just gut feeling and hope that some of these will click one day.
1/3/21, 12:50 PM - +1 (602) 451-9207: <Media omitted>
1/3/21, 12:50 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: In BTC am still not able to understand the fundamental that will support it as currency- no country is adopting it as currency- least of all will be the US or EU- UK did not even accept Euro to be currency and continued with GBP.. so how will BTC becomes the global currency standard
1/3/21, 12:50 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Only use case ethereum has served till date is being platform to create more shitcoins.
1/3/21, 12:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There is always a new narrative in the market (from drug money, to future of money to digital gold and institutional adaption and in the future digitalization of Government currency) Cycle analysis suggests bitcoin does the best year after halvening (2021), and does poorly in year 2 and year 3. History may not repeat itself but it rhymes more often than not)
1/3/21, 12:52 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: i understand use cases wise... i am talking about price due to fomo not uses cases
1/3/21, 12:52 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Currency is supposed to replace barter and have the standard for buy and sell- what commodities/ products are traded through BTC- except for the BTC itself being bought/sold with speculations that it will be the de facto standard
1/3/21, 12:52 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: My personal advice, don't touch anything other than btc and ethereum. Everything else is shitcoins. It may go up, but you will lose your underwear when it crashes.
1/3/21, 12:53 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: I am not raising doubt- that it will fall or is hyper real- want to understand from experts here as to what is the fundamental that will drive BTC overall
1/3/21, 12:53 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Price in long term will track to use cases. It's difficult to predict swing top ups and dip bottoms. Just buy good assets with string use cases.
1/3/21, 12:54 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: Good is that coinbase allows very few coins in its app.
1/3/21, 12:54 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: u can use wazirx in india which has almost all the crypto

pretty easy to use
1/3/21, 12:54 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Coinbase should delist all other coins. None have any utility or use case.
1/3/21, 12:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: When the alt season comes, it is difficult for Eth to not outperform. One also need to understand that stable coins are based on Eth. My latest pick Tritteras does $50MM in revenue and its trade finance platform is based on ERC-20 token. It's a matter of time, corporation understand the benefit of decentralization and blockchain based usage, and ERC-20 will emerge Asa gold standard (not the best, but the widely used)
1/3/21, 12:56 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: If they limit too much they people will stop using it. Their user base will decrease😁

1/3/21, 12:59 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Tether and usdc are king of stablecoins. Stablecoins are most vulnerable to regulations. It's extreme level of stupidity to make it on ethereum blockchain. It's stupid engineering decision.

1/3/21, 1:01 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: ERC20 is not supported by Coinbase.

1/3/21, 1:03 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Almost every coin and token has lost significant value against btc in 5 years.
1/3/21, 1:03 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: So if you plan to invest, btc is best bet.
1/3/21, 1:04 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: If you want to swing trade, ethereum if you can exit at top.
1/3/21, 1:05 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Erc20 contracts are piece of shit. I spent 6 months writing decentralized apps on ethereum,, it's so buggy and prone to hacks that no serious business can be built on it.
1/3/21, 1:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Eth will outperform btc this year. Offcourse we will see at the end if the year, as always
1/3/21, 1:06 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Also, there is no need for single contract to be executed on every ethereum node everytime.

1/4/21, 3:18 AM - +1 (949) 294-4736: I think it's a good way to minimize risk across various upcoming trends in diverse fields... I still have a concern that some of the out performance is due to TSLA & i'm yet to find out. will stay out if it's purely due to tesla :)

1/4/21, 10:45 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: The biggest difference between MARA and RIOT is the number of assets they produce on average. $RIOT already mines more than $MARA, and they plan to increase their output even further. $MARA, on the other hand, is focused on reducing their costs and improving upon their energy efficiency.
1/4/21, 10:45 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Going forward energy efficiency is going to be key in mining

using green energy
1/4/21, 10:47 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: It’s tied to BTC, so if BTC keeps moving up, mara amd riot will move along

mara
riot
cannon
ebon 

all ate blockchain or mining related stocks

Also, mara has plans to deploy plenty of mining’s in Q2 of 2021 which will bring mining cost per BTC under 4000 which will increase MARAs profits

As BTC, these r very speculative

1/4/21, 4:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Guessing $230-$255 as the bottom, but may be early or late when it reverses

1/4/21, 4:23 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: March 5th is the final expiration for all of its lockup, so a dramatic decline during that period should be time of interest

1/4/21, 5:23 PM - +1 (732) 331-3713: there is a hope that current vaccines will successfully work with new strains. 🤞
1/4/21, 6:13 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Yeah let’s hope so.
1/4/21, 6:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not a reason to worry with a day sell-off. Its healthy for the market to take a breather and shake off weak hands. Offcourse , if it turns out to be bad, the charts will tell us. For now, I have a favorable bias for 2021 and sell off should be seen as buying, not selling opportunities.
1/4/21, 6:47 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Only red flag right now is $ melting against world currency, especially Chinese yuan.

Unfortunately, I will not be able to compile a list at this time, however, all of my messages are here, so feel free to create a list. 

I will also be discussing quarterly results, so one  will know of the positions if you are new.
1/4/21, 7:36 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Market most likely will go down with these news. Good will go up
1/4/21, 8:26 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Give it three weeks. It will be under 225.

1/4/21, 8:43 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: For me even $150 is overpriced at this early stage.
1/4/21, 8:45 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah expensive from a traditional valuation metrics, however quality always comes with a price.
1/4/21, 8:46 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: As I have said, I would like to visualize price action and I dont think it's going to $150
1/4/21, 8:46 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Time will tell though
1/4/21, 8:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Here is some of the valuation parameters I discussed earlier. Would love to see in this range. But will be happy to buy of it reverses earlier.

1/5/21, 10:44 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Nash going strong on these SPACs - VRYYF, TRIT, SKLZ, DNMR, INAQ. I though have very small positions.
1/5/21, 10:45 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I sold INAQ
1/5/21, 10:45 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: No reason, difficult to manage

1/5/21, 10:47 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And PDD another 10%
1/5/21, 10:58 AM - +1 (415) 662-3481: I suggest you review SPACs one more time. Many managers are into this SPAC business for quick gains. Just listing companies and pocketing gains should not be prime business. if they are good enough companies, why can't they go through regular IPO process like SNOW instead of these shortcuts? I've seen in the past, some companies with holes in their books and can't do straight IPO used reverse mergers to list. SPAC is a modern name for that
1/5/21, 11:38 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There is lot of benefits of going through SPAC. 1) SPAC has longer term capital through Pipe investors who are longer term allocator of capital.  2) There is assurance of deal closing at an agreed upon price, not freaking out a day before IPO 3) Institutional investors can get at the same price as retail investors 4) Investor capital is also protected because they have the money will be refunded if they are not able to identify a target investment within a certain time frame

Offourse,  there are structuring that happens on a deal by deal basis, that allows institutional investor to get more equity (upon performance) but that is not significantly different from IPO companies paying their executive. The risks are defined in a SPAC, so I like buying it at or slightly above the price most institutions are paying rather than paying a 200% premium on Snow, if that makes sense.
1/5/21, 11:41 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Also there are 100s of spacs which are coming in the market. Offcourse a lot of them will turn out to be crappy. If you know me, I don't invest based on speculation. All of my companies have real revenues behind it, some of them are also cash flow positive.

1/5/21, 1:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Too difficult to manage given the growing list, so took out some of the ones with less conviction.

How do they determine the stock price while refunding- is there any minimum price?
1/5/21, 1:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: $10 is the initial NAV
1/5/21, 1:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The deal happens at that price (capital raised divided by the number of shares)
1/5/21, 1:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It takes time to identify an investment
1/5/21, 1:13 PM - +1 (609) 442-9779: Is that fixed price all the spac stocks?
1/5/21, 1:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So price will be trading around that range

1/5/21, 6:26 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah its OTC, so unless you buy a big lot, the fees are high
1/5/21, 7:05 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I'll check tomorrow....I didn't buy OTC stocks from long time.

1/5/21, 7:08 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: On Fidelity website it says no fee for otc stocks trade. Not sure if there is any fine print that says fees charged on different occasions.
1/5/21, 7:09 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: <Media omitted>
1/5/21, 7:09 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: On TDA, i think its a fixed fee of 6.95$ per txn regardless of no of stocks. The same way it used to work earlier for stocks before RH came and forced all brokerages to go commission free.
1/5/21, 7:10 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: are you sure you tried in Fidelity ?
1/5/21, 7:10 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: correct...same with Fidelity.

1/5/21, 7:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I also paid $50 fee, which I only do for OTC stock
1/5/21, 7:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not in fidelity though
1/5/21, 7:21 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 🙏🏻. Bought many :). So will wait to add.
1/5/21, 7:25 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I am paying 3.95 (for OTC) at ETrade. Don’t know if this is the rate for all or a  privileged rate based on number of transactions/portfolio size.
1/5/21, 7:26 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: https://www.tdameritrade.com/pricing.page
1/5/21, 7:27 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: this is generic information without my login. not sure how they are different unless there is any fine print
1/5/21, 7:28 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Bhai saheb, ye share uthana hai kya? 😀 any news/basis or just tukka?
1/5/21, 7:29 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: $50 per transaction...seems to high for a fee....Call them and negotiate. They do negotiate if you do many trades.
1/5/21, 7:31 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: this is in my watch list from long time....there was a spike due to marijuana so played for short term.
1/5/21, 7:31 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: @12015655130 is VRYF still buy ?
1/5/21, 7:32 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Played and sold OR still keeping it and can be played now?
1/5/21, 7:34 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Yes 😀. I just reached breakeven today.
1/5/21, 7:34 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Thanks
1/5/21, 7:34 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Will add tomorrow
1/5/21, 7:36 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: sold...not recommended for now.
1/5/21, 7:36 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: will update if I'll enter again
1/5/21, 7:36 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👍🏻
1/5/21, 7:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's only on OTC, which I buy few and far between, but I agree it's crazy
1/5/21, 7:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I bought yesterday again paying this stupid $50 fee, so my average cost is $5
1/5/21, 7:49 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Now I know why E*TRADE told me that it’s a no-no when I asked them to reduce my OTC fee down from 3.95. 🙂
1/5/21, 7:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So today's price is not bad
1/5/21, 7:50 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: That’s a motivation to buy more in one lot:). Isn’t it!!!
1/5/21, 7:51 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Planning to buy all listed stocks in small numbers unless Nash says hold 😀
1/5/21, 7:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Absolutely, however it's a volatile stock goes up and down 20-30%, so fee is less important
1/5/21, 7:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Versus position sizing
1/5/21, 7:52 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Thats crazy fee. I am checking my order on TDA the fee says 6.95$
1/5/21, 7:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If they reach half of what they say they will achieve, this will be a 10 bagger
1/5/21, 7:56 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: E*TRADE charging $4.95
1/5/21, 7:56 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Per transaction
1/5/21, 7:57 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Looks better not sure if fees differs person to person

Also before buying any stock, it is a good idea to check on yahoo finance and see the financials. 

Most of the stocks that I see going 100% up are in deep red financially. One news comes they go up and then crash after a week.

1/5/21, 10:33 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Last 15% mostly blue area and he take more lead from red area. So his chance more

1/5/21, 10:55 PM - +1 (917) 578-2068: ABC is saying Democrats will win as the remaining votes are from a county where Democrats are dominated...similar to presidential elections.. but we never know since it is a very close race

1/6/21, 10:14 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: yesterday only I said not recommended and today it is 10% up. I think due to Dem win chance marijuana stocks are going up. Totally missed yesterday this point.
1/6/21, 10:16 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yepp, All MJ stocks are rallying today
1/6/21, 10:31 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Clsk🚀🚀

1/6/21, 10:36 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Ohh man! But you would have made money as always 😜
1/6/21, 10:39 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Not sure what’s going on with TTD, SHOP, CRWD, NET etc. gains of last few months have been wiped out
1/6/21, 10:43 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: I read somehere tech going down due to tax concerns
1/6/21, 10:44 AM - +1 (480) 252-1728: Regular profit booking is needed, respect the bull
1/6/21, 10:44 AM - +1 (717) 385-7085: NET😥😥
1/6/21, 10:47 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: What say of c3.ai.. it’s down again.. has come to 115 from 175
1/6/21, 10:47 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: From the highs of 175 earlier*
1/6/21, 10:47 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Sad about NET. Has come down from 88 to 71
1/6/21, 10:47 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I have a lot and holding it.
1/6/21, 10:48 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: C3.Ai was super overvalued.
1/6/21, 10:48 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Just like many other. Lust is gone. Will take time to recover.
1/6/21, 10:48 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Today tech stock is down and so is C3Ai
1/6/21, 10:49 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: All the techs support Dems but they know that Republicans can get their shares up. 

It’s a funny equation 

Tech Future is down
1/6/21, 10:53 AM - +1 (860) 986-8967: 👍🏻
1/6/21, 10:58 AM - +1 (732) 857-9973: Somehow this doesnt apply to tesla
1/6/21, 10:59 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Correction will happen for Tesla as well.
1/6/21, 11:00 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Tesla story is very different. Everyday there is a positive story. S&P exposure has made the share very strong. So correction will only happen to a limited downfall
1/6/21, 11:00 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I had exit TTD and Shopify long back. CRWD last week. And I am keeping NET long term that is still in minor loss after averaging some today. I will add more NET if falls more.
1/6/21, 11:00 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Also with Dems now in control, Tesla and EV market will go up
1/6/21, 11:03 AM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Dnmr 🚀
1/6/21, 11:04 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: What about BE? Any thoughts on this?
1/6/21, 11:06 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It seems you booked profit at the rt time.
1/6/21, 11:08 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yepp, Need to learn to book profit, any particular strategy we should follow to book profit.
1/6/21, 11:13 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: This is where Upkar will start commenting 🤣
1/6/21, 11:13 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I did it to keep my stocks number down. Hard to handle. Even now I have 47 stocks. I want to limit this to 30.
1/6/21, 11:14 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 😁😁 it’s been long seems he left the group
1/6/21, 11:14 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I mean bullshit can only take you so far!
1/6/21, 11:15 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Sometime you just do it for sake of booking profit. Wo kehte hain na...हाँथ में खुजली 😀. Sometimes I sell just for the sake of doing some trade. Offcourse without touching ling term.
1/6/21, 11:16 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: @15023383068 where are you? Hope all is well.
1/6/21, 11:17 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: He is still in the group. May be travelling to China😉
1/6/21, 11:18 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: He was invested in BABA I guess.... must be in search of Jack Ma
1/6/21, 11:18 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: No wonder jack ma is missing as well
1/6/21, 11:19 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Now we all know who kidnapped Jack ma😀😀
1/6/21, 11:21 AM - +1 (908) 672-5619: Lol
1/6/21, 11:21 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Hopefully he will see some Chinese cars too. Because he was saying they don't exist on roads just because he has not seen any himself.
1/6/21, 11:23 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍👍
1/6/21, 11:24 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Actually he only booked one way flight to china...He is driving NIO (which he bought in Alibaba website) back from china to NJ🙂
1/6/21, 11:25 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 😂😂
1/6/21, 11:25 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: NIO invisible car you meant
1/6/21, 11:25 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Or might be swimming back to jersey from Shanghai
1/6/21, 11:25 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: As that car touches US soil, it becomes visible
1/6/21, 11:25 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 😄
1/6/21, 11:26 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Using some Chinese technology 👩‍💻
1/6/21, 11:26 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Which he will claim was copied from USA.
1/6/21, 11:30 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Well that he is right about. China copies stuff from US and everywhere else.
1/6/21, 11:31 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Like right now I am sitting in front of my portfolio screen and looking to sell something...Need to sell some to have cash by Monday...E*TRADE put me under restriction because I violated 4 times by selling stocks bought by unsettled cash. Was unintentional though but I have to live with it for 90 days. So can not buy anymore with unsettled fund for 90 days....Do you know if RH does not have this restriction?
1/6/21, 11:31 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Enphase 👌
1/6/21, 11:32 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: No
1/6/21, 11:33 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Do you mean they do not have restriction? Plz reply in complete sentence to avoid confusion :). Thanks in advance.
1/6/21, 11:35 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Earlier RH won’t have restrictions if you have 25K. Should be same now
1/6/21, 11:36 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep 55% return for Enphase vs 18% for SEDG.
1/6/21, 11:37 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: During this period
1/6/21, 11:38 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Marijuana are also doing very well. Yolo and GTBIF I suggested earlier. I also have taken curaleaf when it fell couple of days baxk
1/6/21, 11:38 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thank you. May be I will open an account with them as well. Do you know how much they charge for 1)- options, 2)- OTC trade?
1/6/21, 11:39 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👍🏻. 30% for me. I have to add some.
1/6/21, 11:40 AM - Niteen: SKLZ 🚀🚀
1/6/21, 11:41 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I booked profit in YOLO but have GTBIF. Actually all cannabis is up today. What should be the strategy? Long term or book profit?
1/6/21, 11:42 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Check the cash vs margin account since margin is more flexed
1/6/21, 11:43 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: One should have good exposure to Marijuana companies and solar energy atleast during the biden term
1/6/21, 11:43 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I meant 30%. Not .30
1/6/21, 11:43 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: PLNHF has been good too
1/6/21, 11:44 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Marijuana is so beaten down, I had no doubt of atleast couple of baggers at least within next 4 years
1/6/21, 11:45 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: IIPR has been so good when u recommended initially, didnt get a chance to enter yet it keeps on running away. Whats good price to enter ?
1/6/21, 11:46 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: RH doesnt support OTC, but you can confirm
1/6/21, 11:47 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's gone up too fast
1/6/21, 11:47 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: You can do options with $5 monthly membership only 

I don’t think RH supports OTC
1/6/21, 11:47 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 145-165
1/6/21, 11:47 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: ?
1/6/21, 11:48 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: IIPR is a reit for cannabis companies
1/6/21, 11:48 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: One of the best reit in the market
1/6/21, 11:48 AM - Niteen: Any good recommendations?
1/6/21, 11:49 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Mid teens unleverred IRR
1/6/21, 11:49 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Was dirty cheap, but not any more
1/6/21, 11:49 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Other company is ROKU, just unstoppable. Good for long at this price ?
1/6/21, 11:49 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: What is your buy price
1/6/21, 11:50 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yolo, GTBIF and Curaleaf I own
1/6/21, 11:50 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They are all high today

1/6/21, 11:51 AM - Niteen: 👍what should be entry price for each?
1/6/21, 11:51 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Too extended dude, cannot even touch it
1/6/21, 11:52 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Next red day, you can take a position and average if goes down
1/6/21, 11:52 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: All have gone up
1/6/21, 11:52 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So there is a risk of fall for each
1/6/21, 11:53 AM - Niteen: Ok..sounds good 👍
1/6/21, 11:53 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I missed Yolo with my limit order couple weeks back when it was 16. I have gtibf at 21

1/6/21, 11:55 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Roku was the first stock  discussion in this group around $80, so its up 300%. I need a good retracement in roku atleast 20 odd percent
1/6/21, 11:55 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Look at curaleaf also
1/6/21, 11:55 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: 😃 It will reverse again after 1/21
1/6/21, 11:56 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 😅😅👍
1/6/21, 11:56 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Missed it
1/6/21, 11:56 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I have it on my watchlist. Between curaleaf and yolo is one looking better than the other?
1/6/21, 11:57 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You have plenty of other good ones though
1/6/21, 11:58 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yolo is etf, it's much cheaper because it's still 20% from its high. Curaleaf is one of the best cannabis stock, so its at all time high.
1/6/21, 11:58 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Difficult to select
1/6/21, 12:00 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Do you own NVTA?
1/6/21, 12:01 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Thanks
1/6/21, 12:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yes sir
1/6/21, 12:07 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There is resistance at $48 for nvta so might do a retracement then
1/6/21, 12:08 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: All time high is 62, which it should reach after breaking that resistance
1/6/21, 12:17 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 1)- Any idea on GRWG, CWBHF? I have some. Add or sell to add YOLO/Curaleaf?
2)- if you have to chose one out of yolo/GTBIF/Curaleaf, which one you pick?
1/6/21, 12:25 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 1) GRWG has questionable management, historically involved in pump and dump scheme. There was a short report from Heisenberg. If I am not able to validate a report, I typically would stay away from it. Charlotte Web is a Canadian stock. I typically stay away from Canadian companies due to oversupply issue.

2) Cannot pick one.
1/6/21, 12:27 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: @12015655130  1)- on solar energy what do you recommend? I have CTEC, FCEL, GOEV, PLUG, (solar + EV)
2)- and what about EV during Biden?
1/6/21, 12:31 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thankyou. Just sold GRWG at 30% profit. Not bad. CWBHF is currently at 15% loss. Will wait a bit a sell. Thanks again.
1/6/21, 12:33 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 1) Enphase and solar edge on solar energy. Others may be good, but I haven't looked at it 2) I don't like any EV stock. It's too expensive for my taste
1/6/21, 12:34 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: GRWG can do well if the short report is wrong or nothing is uncovered. I am just not willing to take risk
1/6/21, 12:38 PM - +1 (713) 446-1016: Something going on with him. He will be back soon.
1/6/21, 12:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: For EV stock, one can look at FIII (spac acquiring ELMS), Its cheap vs others , they have manufacturing facility (existing Hummer plant) that can roll out distribution vehicle starting next year, have contracts with car companies
1/6/21, 12:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I dont own a position though

1/6/21, 1:09 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: DRIV an ETF with good holding .. what is your take on it ?
1/6/21, 1:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Doesn't look bad with Apple, Google, tesla Nvidia as some of their top holdings
1/6/21, 1:20 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Yes.. Does it fit in your parameters for long term investment ?
1/6/21, 1:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah if you want a passive strategy, that works because it doesn't have too many speculative position.

 I like individual stocks rather than etf.
1/6/21, 1:22 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Ok
1/6/21, 1:22 PM - Niteen: Any good recommendations for kids college funds?
1/6/21, 1:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: *I like to pick  individual stocks where I can. ARKG and Yolo are  2 etf I hold. The former is because I don't have too much expertise in genomic, 2nd was very undervalued when I bought at $12.5

So, with this new development there is no change really. And there is nothing to fear unless you're caught in a federal crime or something that serious. Although it is serious violation of privacy.
1/7/21, 10:59 AM - +1 (860) 986-8967: With Btc surge,if one wants indirect exposure (without having to pay any premium) which is pretty much a direct (60%)exposure to  btc now, you may want to check MSTR , company now worth 5B worth with all cash reserve of 3B in btc (70470 Bitcoin) .

1/7/21, 11:00 AM - +1 (862) 290-1331: JAGX Conference Monday to announce cancer treatments and HIV / COVID diarrhea medication

Talks of this getting merged with a SPAC which should turn this to a runner at $10+ which could net 500%. You have until Friday at close to make a position, as this is all being announced speculatively on Monday.  They've had a bunch of good news, such as they have enough cash, no reverse merger needed. It's shown a lot of resistance around $1.90 - $2.00 so I consider this the floor. 

Blurb below,  
  
JAGX has an  FDA approved organic treatment (Crofelemer/Mytesi) that is being used to treat HIV  with the potential to treat multiple health issues including COVID-19, cancer,  cholera, and psychological disorders, increasing sales revenue quarter over quarter. Jaguar Health, Inc. and the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Napo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. doing a merger in Europe and has conducted intellectual property filings in support of the development of crofelemer for the potential indication of addressing inflammatory diarrhea, including specifically in a long-hauler post-COVID recovery situation which is estimated to affect 15% (or 100 million) of the world population.  
    
Extra;  

Three year cancer study completed on Dec 20, 2020 and results are supposed to be outstanding and released Jan 2021. Mytesi sales has started spiking as is...just imagine what the sales would be like if JAGX gets Cancer and COVID FDA approval! This will be a $20-$30 stock if we get both $$  
  
Ticker: JAGX  
Price: $2  
Market Cap: $169mn  
Sector: Biotech  / Pharma    
  
tips: don't rush it, you have all day, I expect it to 'melt up' on friday. Try to find a good entry.   

tl;dr buy some hold for monday announcements 75% chance to 2.5x your money.

1/7/21, 11:28 AM - +1 (860) 986-8967: Copied From Yahoo comments:

MSTR:
70,470 BTC. 9.27M/70,470=.0076 BTC/share X 37,700=$287 of BTC per share. Core biz $500 million revenue x 8=$4.0 billion/9.27=$431+$287 BTC=$718.  Other BTC ETF at 28% premium. 287 x .28=$80.  Stock should be valued at $800 today. 1 million shares short, 
it could squeeze to much more in a week
1/7/21, 11:38 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: as per yahoo comments Mara should be 100 and riot 200 per current BTC price

1/7/21, 12:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I can very well see why the price reversed from here but need confirmation
1/7/21, 12:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I would have pounded on the table, if lockup expiration wasn't coming. Hope it goes lower
1/7/21, 12:18 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: When is the expiration,end of the month?
1/7/21, 12:18 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: @12015655130

1/7/21, 12:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Perfect recipe for lower prices
1/7/21, 12:19 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Oh that's tricky. Q results might be very good.
1/7/21, 12:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah, people may profit book after quarter, because nothing in sight for next 2 mos, along with the flood of share coming up
1/7/21, 12:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Next 3 mos
1/7/21, 12:20 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Yeah but it might go over 300 again around the results
1/7/21, 12:20 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: No?
1/7/21, 12:23 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Possible, I don't want to play the timing game, so want to settle when everyone is settled selling
1/7/21, 12:24 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: 👍🏼 makes sense.

1/7/21, 12:33 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: But future earnings could lift these up because they now have huge funding post IPO
1/7/21, 12:34 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Dash is widely used and growing significantly. They have captured India small cities market as well

1/7/21, 1:17 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Any specific reason for this suggestion?
1/7/21, 1:19 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Financials are very weak
1/7/21, 1:20 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: TTM (trailing 12M) revenue is 97M with exp of 217M, loss of 121M
1/7/21, 1:22 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I guess that’s normal for all these growth stocks.
I got it recommended by Motley to hold it for long term in the December stock recommendation, holding for a month now and happy with the returns so far.

1/7/21, 1:57 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I saw that. And thought an opportunity to get in. Any way it’s a ling term game. So happy to keep it for a year and will go from there.
1/7/21, 1:59 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: But the offering is at 16.70 that is higher than current price. Is this just the sentiment?

1/7/21, 4:09 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: There has to be some satisfaction. Imagine if Tesla would have gone to 700?
1/7/21, 4:10 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: There is v little fundamentals, it’s all sentiments in the market driving all these stocks crazy. When the fall will start, it will not stop.
1/7/21, 4:11 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Tesla 820+
1/7/21, 4:11 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It’s an amazing story. Once in lifetime
1/7/21, 4:13 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: TSLA has become lot more stable post S&P 500 inclusion, can’t bet against it anymore.... learnt the lesson hard way, I doubt that it will fall any time soon.
There earnings will be superb and it would rally further, also the thing is if it goes to 900-1000 and then drops by 10-15%(which I doubt) it still would be higher than the current price ....
1/7/21, 4:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I thought Bitcoin is 1 in a lifetime story 😉
1/7/21, 4:14 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: True!

1/8/21, 8:53 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Anand bhai need a suggestion on MARA....
Does MARA has long term potential? I am planning to book profit today, shall I sell all or keep some for long term, if it has good potential.
1/8/21, 8:57 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: It is connected with cryptocurrency. So, if crypto will go up then it will go up. 
I am already regretting on taking short term profits on it earlier. I have much less stocks now than I had at the time it was at $5.
I would suggest to hold it for now until you see big dip coming in cryptocurrency.
1/8/21, 8:59 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: Mara sold out all shares as dilution in december which causes price dip from 15 to 9.60

unless btc sees 30/40 correction, mara is hold

my opinion
1/8/21, 8:59 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Cool, will not book any profit today and hold it for now

1/8/21, 12:32 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: TDOC comes down really fast if market goes down, rt now it’s kind of in its peak, as you already own it, you can wait for a pullback and then add, below 200s it’s a good buy I guess.
1/8/21, 12:33 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: $183 is fair value per the report
1/8/21, 12:33 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: My 2 cents - when the market is hot and up, we should resist buying. Sometime we miss the race but most of the time we are safe
1/8/21, 12:34 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I am saying it based on my bad experience

1/8/21, 12:43 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Billionaire Tom Siebel's C3.ai hires banks for 2021 U.S. IPO - sources


(Reuters) - C3.ai, a software company founded by billionaire tech entrepreneur Tom Siebel, has hired investment banks to help it prepare for an initial public offering which could come next year, according to people familiar with the matter.

The IPO could value the firm significantly higher than its previous valuation of $3.3 billion, the sources said, cautioning that the timing of the flotation was subject to change.

Redwood City, California-based C3 is working with JPMorgan Chase & Co and other banks on IPO preparations, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the plans are confidential.

C3 did not respond to requests for comment. JPMorgan declined to comment.
1/8/21, 12:43 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Now I know why it is going up

On his behalf I will donate to this family who is in need

1/8/21, 1:45 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 👍🏻 you are a good hearted person. I came across so many people who don’t even thank others for the benefit they got. Very rare who want to give it back.

1/8/21, 2:00 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: JAGX Conference Monday to announce cancer treatments and HIV / COVID diarrhea medication

Talks of this getting merged with a SPAC which should turn this to a runner at $10+ which could net 500%. You have until Friday at close to make a position, as this is all being announced speculatively on Monday.  They've had a bunch of good news, such as they have enough cash, no reverse merger needed. It's shown a lot of resistance around $1.90 - $2.00 so I consider this the floor. 

Blurb below,  
  
JAGX has an  FDA approved organic treatment (Crofelemer/Mytesi) that is being used to treat HIV  with the potential to treat multiple health issues including COVID-19, cancer,  cholera, and psychological disorders, increasing sales revenue quarter over quarter. Jaguar Health, Inc. and the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Napo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. doing a merger in Europe and has conducted intellectual property filings in support of the development of crofelemer for the potential indication of addressing inflammatory diarrhea, including specifically in a long-hauler post-COVID recovery situation which is estimated to affect 15% (or 100 million) of the world population.  
    
Extra;  

Three year cancer study completed on Dec 20, 2020 and results are supposed to be outstanding and released Jan 2021. Mytesi sales has started spiking as is...just imagine what the sales would be like if JAGX gets Cancer and COVID FDA approval! *This will be a $20-$30 stock if we get both $$ *
  
Ticker: JAGX  
Price: $2  
Market Cap: $169mn  
Sector: Biotech  / Pharma    
  
tips: don't rush it, you have all day, I expect it to 'melt up' on friday. Try to find a good entry.   

tl;dr buy some hold for monday announcements 75% chance to 2.5x your money.

1/9/21, 9:51 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: someone said that the group size in Signal is 150 only.

Do we know if SIGNAL or any other app wont share our data. i dont get the hype for migrating this group to some other platform. Whatsapp was anyways owned by FB so we dont know what it would have been already sharing. Are you all going to really delete whatsapp app bcoz this grp doesn have any personal data whereas we have so much personal data our photos everything floated everywhere.

1/9/21, 10:37 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Is telegram not monitoring our data ?
1/9/21, 10:38 AM - +1 (201) 850-0479: Once chat messages arrive at the Telegram servers, they are encrypted using MTProto while at rest on the servers. However, Telegram can read chat data since it handles the encryption/decryption of messages at the servers. ... Secret Chats should be as secure as MTProto, but users need to remember to turn them on.
1/9/21, 10:38 AM - +1 (717) 385-7085: By the way what sensitive data we are sharing here ?? 🤔🤔🤔
1/9/21, 10:39 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Yes even with whatsapp encrypts every message
1/9/21, 10:39 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Exactly not alteast the personal data we float across all other grps in whatsapp

1/9/21, 10:43 AM - +1 (646) 413-2283: Or our investments
1/9/21, 10:43 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Yes google has all information where we travel all maps lets quit google 😀
1/9/21, 10:44 AM - +1 (646) 413-2283: Let’s build our own dark web
1/9/21, 10:44 AM - +1 (408) 396-9658: I think telegram is part of that also . But again if we all are interested to move to telegram then no issue . What’s ur thought @17325013097 bhai
1/9/21, 10:44 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: 😀

1/9/21, 10:46 AM - +1 (732) 986-0073: May be i have not checked.

1/9/21, 10:47 AM - +1 (408) 396-9658: Correct
1/9/21, 10:48 AM - +1 (732) 277-7743: If all of us are plan on quitting the WhatsApp entirely, then it make sense to move else there is no point
1/9/21, 10:49 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Eventually that’s the plan. So start somewhere.

1/9/21, 10:50 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Now their policy says - no change in Privacy Policy for Non-Business users. 

*WhatsApp issues clarification after continuous social media criticism and backlash over the new update, says "It is only for business chats".*

1/9/21, 10:51 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: I guess things can be easily assessed by quantification. Please do +1 on this message if you plan to quit whatsapp completely and then admin can evaluate the count
1/9/21, 10:51 AM - +1 (314) 480-2493: Also let’s keep in mind the performance and ease of using WhatsApp..
1/9/21, 10:54 AM - +1 (551) 580-3181: if whatsapp makes money they can provide free service. How Signal is making money . I know it's open source but some one has to pay for servers
1/9/21, 10:55 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: this is not acceptable in this group to let ppl move to another group. I'll not encourage this.
1/9/21, 10:56 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Nothing comes free. All
takes the data. 

We are exposed everywhere.
1/9/21, 10:56 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: My suggestion is we should not panic. What we discuss is very simple things. Everyone should take precaution in all the platforms anyway 🙏🏽
1/9/21, 10:57 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: are*
1/9/21, 10:57 AM - +1 (551) 580-3181: I don't believe this news, when fb bought the whatsapp in 2014 with such a huge deal and in their business model they have to make a money. Not to run a charitable service
1/9/21, 10:57 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Agree Srinivas ji 🙏🏽
1/9/21, 10:57 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I am glad whatsapp and FB is getting huge hit. They deserve it.

1/9/21, 11:00 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I have been using for a while, and I dont see any issues with it. Just my 2c
1/9/21, 11:01 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Whatever you guys decide, am with it
1/9/21, 11:02 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Nash do you plan to quit whatsapp for good ?
1/9/21, 11:05 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: I am also ok with anything just evaluating how it be feasible to quit whatsapp completely since it provides so much flexibility in global calling and sharing
1/9/21, 11:05 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: One more important thing is - if we are saying no to this whatsapp group .. it might not solve your problem unless you are coming out of whatsapp completely (which includes individual chats and any other group you are part of)
1/9/21, 11:06 AM - +1 (732) 986-0073: We all use whatsapp , and I believe we all have many family and friends use whatsapp,  also we have many other social groups. Good thing being in whats app is we do not have to switch to check messages from one app to another.
1/9/21, 11:07 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Gradually every one will move away from whatsapp, that's my take. Wait and watch
1/9/21, 11:07 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not quitting, but I am more sensitive to the data shared here versus my other groups
1/9/21, 11:08 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Also, 250 member limit is constraining IMO, we should get as many talented investors as possible
1/9/21, 11:08 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: My 2x
1/9/21, 11:08 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 2c
1/9/21, 11:10 AM - +1 (732) 986-0073: We can parallely create our group in telegram and switch when it is right time to move.

1/9/21, 11:23 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: FB has become the bread and butter now for business. They have conquered the world for now. 

Every small business that sells online is unable to do it without FB, Insta
1/9/21, 11:23 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: World has changed.

1/9/21, 11:24 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: WhatsApp had been giving data, now they have made formal. Anyone can see the documentaries out there. Once you see it, you would like quitting everything
1/9/21, 11:25 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It’s like COVID vaccine. If you see the articles, 80% of the health workers are against taking it as they think they are made Guinea Pigs

1/9/21, 12:02 PM - +1 (732) 331-3713: Let's help the admin.. Let's have moderators... I can volunteer to be one.. Also the point is not to force to collect money... I hope even donations can keep the lights on comfortably
1/9/21, 12:17 PM - +1 (609) 216-4502: Since Elon Musk prefers Signal, lets give him respect for getting us some good returns :P
1/9/21, 12:18 PM - +1 (609) 216-4502: Currently I switched to Signal cause my college buddies voted for it, so I am a little biased :)
1/9/21, 12:21 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: For tomorrow's meet to decide on messaging platform for our stock group. Also, we will know each other more. Kind of get together 🙂 .

1/9/21, 12:22 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I am also exploring Signal app.
1/9/21, 12:24 PM - +1 (732) 762-4064: 👍
1/9/21, 12:26 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: one major issue I see with telegram is mobile number is not visible. So, it is hard to know who has joined from which country number. This will be another security issue. Lets talk tomorrow on pros n cons.
1/9/21, 12:28 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Thanks Anand .. hopefully this meeting will help in taking a decision.
1/9/21, 12:28 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Also, anyone can add member in the group but not limited to only admin. I experienced this. I am not sure if there is any setting which can prevent this....so more security issue.
1/9/21, 12:29 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: If encryption is happening on server side. Obviously, they can peek into the data
1/9/21, 12:29 PM - +1 (732) 762-4064: My 2 cents
At this point people are panicking. Once you start using any social media platform you are information is out there. All you need to be careful of what you share on them and in this group we do not share anything which is already out in the public. I will be ok with any platform you guys pick, we need to be just careful what we do 🙏
1/9/21, 12:33 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: It doesnt matter what app we use. Not like we share secret info here. WhatsApp has been sharing data with facebook since 2014. They just made it official now because Democrat administration is coming which will go hard on big tech companies. Signal is definitely better but will we be able to keep the same momentum there? Time will tell. 
PS: it's time facebook insta WhatsApp are broken into different companies. Same for amazon retail, video, marketplace, AWS, pharma etc.

1/9/21, 12:36 PM - Niteen: What if FB buys Signal tomorrow like they bought WhatsApp?
1/9/21, 12:38 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Then time for Elon to launch new app
1/9/21, 12:38 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: 😀
1/9/21, 12:39 PM - Niteen: Yes..one more launching a platform..if you know 😜🤓
1/9/21, 12:40 PM - Niteen: Also, boycotting WhatsApp is not enough you need to boycott entire company..all the product..like FB + Insta + other FB products.. boycott Google too..
1/9/21, 12:49 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: these are stocks or options
1/9/21, 12:51 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: Today we want to quit whatsapp , tomorrow it will be telegram, and then signal..

Are we really saying that in this digital world without some dark web stuff our data is really secure..

So why so much panic..
1/9/21, 12:53 PM - Niteen: Yeah..sudden awakening happening in the world with regard to data privacy 😃
1/9/21, 12:54 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Agree.. and most importantly.. if we are completely closing our fb, whatapp, insta  profile then might help .. else just by switching this group to other platform and still using WhatsApp for other group or individual conversations will not help in any way..
1/9/21, 12:55 PM - +1 (213) 568-8440: We literally cannot go back to paper age.. otherwise let's agree that digital worls has it's pros and cons..

Data sharing is there and it will be
1/9/21, 12:55 PM - +1 (757) 285-8122: My 2 cents: I believe legally these companies are not supposed to share user generated data. Model followed in tech industry is based on analytics. 

That does not mean sharing private photos or content. It can be a derived analysis from private content. There is difference between private data and analysis. Analytics does not identify users but an aggregated value of kind of users. 

I believe big companies to follow legal rules like FB, Google, Apple than any open source app or small companies. Data security is a severe matter and these companies can not loose their credibility based on security breaches. 

Whatsapp is a much matured product that any other novice apps. I would continue using whatsapp while exploring other options.

1/9/21, 1:06 PM - +1 (917) 578-2068: Very true. Who is not collecting info lately ? We have to be just cautious and not share personal info and we should be good.
1/9/21, 1:07 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: Please watch Snowden on Netflix
1/9/21, 1:10 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: What is it related to?
1/9/21, 1:11 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: How everyones data is monitored
1/9/21, 1:11 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Oh. Sounds interesting. Will watch 👍🏻
1/9/21, 1:11 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: It’s based on real story of Edward Snowden — whistleblower
1/9/21, 1:15 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: We will get out of WhatsApp, FB stocks will go down, then we will buy the stocks, it will go up and we will join WhatsApp back 😃

The only thing that is safe is #PaanDukaanHangout where we meet, have fun, eat Pan and go home 😃😃
1/9/21, 1:15 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Paan wala used to be FB that time. Knew all the secrets of all 😃😃

1/9/21, 2:16 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: I am ok with anything. Using IOT devices, the privacy has always been on stake and won't be worse using whats app. 😁
1/9/21, 2:16 PM - +1 (917) 584-6536: Let’s not rush the decision. I think FB will backtrack and we don’t need to migrate.
1/9/21, 2:17 PM - +1 (917) 584-6536: We have almost a month to wait and watch.

1/9/21, 5:32 PM - Niteen: 👍
1/9/21, 7:05 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: If I am hearing correctly then they will not read the content of the group that what kind of chat is going on. They will catch what location you are in, what status you are maintaining. 
However the major security issue which is financial information that will go from whatsapp business app which I don't think we are using.
Please let me know if I am missing anything here.
1/9/21, 7:06 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: that's true and it applies to all the products including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, Gmail etc etc
1/9/21, 7:11 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: A simple thing - Alexa at our home track everything. The phone that we hold tracks everything. Listens to
All we say
1/9/21, 7:11 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: just read. it looks for long term investment stock. lets see how it goes next week.
1/9/21, 7:11 PM - +1 (201) 673-4866: I agreed with you. FB will use this information for marketing and business purposes. But we should not share any sensitive data like credentials or any banking details which might be a big threat. Apart from that, they are planning to start what's up pay and other features which will use profile, phone no, contact and location information as they use it for FB. Same is with Google products and OS too
1/9/21, 7:13 PM - +1 (201) 673-4866: Frankly speaking, this is common for all Google products or apps as well as FB or other apps who are using our contacts, files and other information.
1/9/21, 7:13 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: sharing anything in chat is anyway difficult to track that it is banking information until we pay connection our bank account with whatsapp pay / whatsapp business.
1/9/21, 7:14 PM - +1 (201) 673-4866: Sometimes we share credentials in pictures but now that is not safe because image readers OCRs are going to be stronger day by day
1/9/21, 7:15 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: If we talk about only for thing group where we are discussing stocks and investment plans will hardly impact. I think it has more impact to the ppl who are leaving whatsapp forever.
1/9/21, 7:15 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I don't know how many of us decided to delete whatsapp.
1/9/21, 7:16 PM - +1 (201) 673-4866: True. I don't see any impact of this group to talk about stocks. Anyways, if we are using whats up for other reason than it will remain same
1/9/21, 7:16 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: until then it doesn't look like security issue for this group. however lets talk in tomorrow's call. May be I am missing some points which will come up in tomorrow's call.
1/9/21, 7:16 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: yup

Call is a great idea. We should know more each other. Thanks for doing it.
1/9/21, 7:28 PM - +1 (201) 673-4866: True. Sorry, I am unavailable tomorrow but whatever you guys will decide... I am good with it.
1/9/21, 7:30 PM - +1 (929) 215-4132: I think more or less what ever we share with any free web chat applications is insecure..If we are considering just security.. I would stick to big company’s like fb as they have prestige to maintain and they can put in big money if any security breach... if we have group size issue then it’s different story and telegram can be option as it has already proved and many ppl use it..
1/9/21, 7:32 PM - +1 (929) 215-4132: Going to new web chats is like taking COVID vaccine 😂.. let more ppl take first 😂
1/9/21, 7:45 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am not sure of the hesitancy to try something else. Telegram as it suggests have end to end encryption. It says even telegram engineers cannot get access. On top of that there is size restriction in this group. 

I am growth investor and I am always thinking of how do we get access to more research, more ideas, more smart people that everyone can collectively benefit. It's great that we are a community helping each other, but we should be thinking of what next vs what is today.
1/9/21, 7:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I will not be able to join tomorrow, but my vote is to go with any app that is secure and not restrict user growth.
1/9/21, 8:10 PM - +1 (203) 543-6706: This message was deleted
1/9/21, 8:44 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: To me, this is misconstrued information. How a public company again merge with a spac? It looks like the European counter part is merging with the spac and it’s not very clear what it’s relationship with JAGX. 
Could be pump&dump schema. So beware.

1/9/21, 9:54 PM - +1 (972) 693-4283: Others are too high.While XLM is priced low. And  is #4 ranked per coinbase. But we should know what XLM does.

1/9/21, 10:08 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Perfect, thanks
1/9/21, 10:08 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Signal is good, lets keep both for now as Signal is struggling to cope up with Mr Musk tweet :)

1/10/21, 1:06 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Guys what did we just do...
1/10/21, 1:06 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I couldn't take it anymore so I ended up doing a write up..

1/10/21, 1:06 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Concerned about WhatsApp's updated privacy policies? If you're feeling stabbed in the back by it after you painstakingly gathered your classmates, family members, aunt and their memorabilia on WhatsApp platform, perhaps read my views (and share yours) on your options

1/10/21, 1:09 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: In short,
To my (Nikunj’s) friends hurriedly moving to Signal and Telegram from WhatsApp because the recent “privacy infringing terms” imply that Facebook will snoop into their privacy on WhatsApp, let me tell you as Software Architect that privacy was already an illusion. They all already snooped. Please consider the following humble but important facts to put your crusade in context:

 1. Moving to other app is *namesake* and illusionary. What if Signal changes terms 6 months later and says all your data is theirs and by the way we already *snooped* on you - check our terms buried deep...?
 2. Signal has group size limit of just 150 and Telegram is a *Russian app*. Have you figured out how to manage these issues when you move from Palo Alto to Belarus 😆?
 3. Facebook / Twitter can buy Signal if it becomes popular rapidly - just remember WhatsApp was bought insanely pricey.
Have you also deleted your Facebook accounts (guess not!)?
 4. Will you stop posting personal pictures / messages on Facebook starting now that you used to post on WhatsApp?
 5. Will you stop investing in Facebook stocks or you’d remain active investor to benefit from its growth?
 6. Some 2.6 BILLION users are on WhatsApp. Will you be able to move your grandpa to Signal from WhatsApp? Remember Orkut?

Your privacy is already lost to N number of platforms. Don’t lose it to 2 more!

I “grudgingly” feel we stay put (or build our own servers and host own social apps at home).
1/10/21, 1:10 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Excellent write up!
1/10/21, 1:10 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Thanks. Like it on LinkedIn if you want to ;)
1/10/21, 1:10 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I did.
1/10/21, 1:11 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: 6 months later signal will change terms to sel your data
1/10/21, 1:11 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: This message was deleted
1/10/21, 1:12 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Then what will you do? Already their servers crash they’d also need money! There’s no free lunch. 30 yesss of free internet cost millions of servers running around the clock. Do the math
1/10/21, 1:46 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Corrections /Additions - Signal group chat can have unlimited people as posted in reddit by one of its developer, however it takes longer for message to deliver to a larger group. 

Telegram was made by Russian and started in Russia but later moved to Berlin. The Russian Court even ruled to block Telegram in Russia. Currently it's HQ is London and Dubai.

Both are non profit organization and well capitalized to run their operations in the short to mid term. Given the surge from whatsapp, their team understands that data security is their #1 priority.  

I own Facebook too, but given the negative media they have been receiving from Netflix's social Dilemma, to increase scrutiny from regulators and now Musk and Dorsey's support to privacy, its entirely possible that Facebook may not be the company that it was in the past, and an entirely new approach is required to run a social media empire.
1/10/21, 1:49 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: A paid model is another option if we want to avoid data sharing - monthly Facebook bill.. no free lunch..
Down the line even signal will either sell your data or ask u to pay, especially if it’s non profit like Wikipedia
1/10/21, 1:49 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: This message was deleted
1/10/21, 1:50 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: People should have the option to choose whether they want to pay for the product or be the product themselves.
1/10/21, 1:50 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I’d Prefer for profit than non profit. More command!
1/10/21, 1:51 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Yes. From current bad situation if no control over privacy, this is first small step
1/10/21, 1:55 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Really interested in seeing Facebook's stock price in short to medium term and quarterly earnings commentary. May be this also turn like Baba for me
1/10/21, 1:57 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Guys, I would say do not rush to join this group.
Even if we will decide to mve to telegram then we will have our own group.
This is just shared by one which is not correct way to move.
1/10/21, 1:58 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: We were together in 2020 and we will be together going forward also.
1/10/21, 1:58 AM - +1 (917) 578-2068: 👍🏼
1/10/21, 1:58 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Kindly wait for a day.
1/10/21, 1:58 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍
1/10/21, 1:58 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: 👍👍👍👍
1/10/21, 2:03 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Btw a third of the people already joined the above group. If all decide, rather than creating a new one, this could also be capitalized. Obviously Anand founded this group and has to be an admin/owner, even though this was started by Shakti.
1/10/21, 2:06 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Lets go together Nash bhai. I felt bad with such share. I can see lots of people moved. 
Just to avoid such things going forward, we will join to our own group.
I also want you to be admin as well as you have contributed a lot to this group n we all benefitted from it.
1/10/21, 2:09 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Agree we should all go together 👍
1/10/21, 2:48 AM - +1 (408) 905-7058: We are thinking to go to Russian telegram app or group-size limited Signal app whose servers are crashing?
Not clear to me so just asking 😁
Keep in mind Facebook can buy Signal or telegram again, with small change $ on its hands and group-size limit does exist (150) due to slowness
1/10/21, 2:53 AM - +1 (973) 727-6428: Agree with u!!!👍
1/10/21, 8:17 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: 👍🏻
1/10/21, 8:17 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Agreed !
1/10/21, 8:33 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not sure you keep referring to Telegram as Russian as its bad. Let's read the story of Pavel Durov who created Telegram. He even exiled from his country after refusing to share data with Kremlin. Telegram is even banned in Iran, China, Pakistan and others for not allowing state actors to monitor its network. 

Regarding FB buying Signal, technically it's not possible for profit to buy non profit organizations, because there are no owners. They can control the board members, but not sure how will it pass the regulators sniff test. As you know US has filed anti-competitive cases on FB over their previous acquisition (and is on top of its list). I am pretty sure that Facebook cannot or will not be able to do anything here.
1/10/21, 8:34 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not suggesting one over the other, but laying the facts.
1/10/21, 8:35 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: JFYI, signal having issues in one of the other groups after adding 25 members, not able to add any more, thst could be signal infrastructure might have choked last 2 days due to large influx
1/10/21, 8:36 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: So hold on for any decision to move to signal
1/10/21, 8:56 AM - +1 (973) 405-0388: Don’t know much detail
But Open Whisper and Whisper Systems connected to Maxie Marlinspike. Marlinspike connected to Singal.  And Whisper was sold to Twitter!!!!
1/10/21, 9:03 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I said the same thing yesterday. They always shared info since 2014. Just made it public now due to Dems coming to power and crackdown on big tech coming. 
Also Belarus is not in Russia! It's a country.

1/10/21, 9:05 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: The fact that Iran, China, Pakistan had banned it means it's a good app doing right things and preventing snooping. I have more respect for telegram now!
1/10/21, 9:10 AM - +1 (917) 574-3123: Telegram is working in Pakistan without any issues
1/10/21, 9:11 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah it's incredibly fast and easy to use, can host upto 200k members, practically unlimited storage, private, very well funded and owners have the right motivations.
1/10/21, 9:13 AM - +1 (201) 208-1249: Isn’t this true for telegram also -
One wise man once said "If you are not paying for the product, you are the product"
1/10/21, 9:14 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Some years back there was an outrage for Pakistani people not able to access it. May be they are using VPN like Chinese do.

1/10/21, 9:21 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Hmm. The usual choice in the world we live in is not between the  good and the bad, but between the bad and the worse.
1/10/21, 9:22 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: 👌 👌 👌
1/10/21, 10:03 AM - +1 (201) 208-1249: Some good info on signal

1/10/21, 10:10 AM - +1 (408) 718-6359: using both telegram and signal, I feel Signal is far better than Telegram.
1/10/21, 10:13 AM - +1 (516) 653-8250: Whatever u guys decide, I hv installed both app on phone as prerequisite 🤪
1/10/21, 10:13 AM - +1 (201) 850-0875: <Media omitted>
1/10/21, 10:14 AM - +1 (201) 850-0875: It says no change in privacy policy for non business users.

1/10/21, 10:18 AM - +1 (917) 406-2999: I still feel, this group has been very active and productive, we hardly have 10% active members here so limit constraint shouldn’t be an issue. If at all, we move to other platform with reins in someone else hands may disrupts whole thing.
1/10/21, 10:40 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Swaroop there will always be 10% active members, however if we grow bigger the number of contributors may increase significantly. Compounding works like magic guys, I have seen that work for years in my portfolio, we should let our knowledge compound by being open and not restrictive to more people.
1/10/21, 11:37 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Gentle reminder for 12 PM est time call. Please join.

1/10/21, 12:25 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Please check Forbes link I shared.

The mass protests in Belarus against the de facto dictatorship of Alexander Lukashenko after the fraudulent elections of August 9 were organized using the encrypted platform Telegram.

Who said Belarus is not a separate country? Neither the Russian gov yet has control over Telegram data ‘yet’
1/10/21, 12:28 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Yep. It’s encrypted and also uses domain fronting.
Just be aware that you’d use yet another “free” service on internet. Nothing is free and the economics of privacy will change in future after you surrendered your privacy to one more platform 🤷‍♂️
1/10/21, 12:30 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I don’t agree. I think the choice is pay for product or be the product.
We are too spoilt and used to using everything on internet for free for 30 years. Time to learn that millions of servers for years cost money
1/10/21, 12:35 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I said this but I am not sure new generation mentally reads before mentally writing
1/10/21, 12:35 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Not sure then “what exactly changed” for anyone here 🤦‍♂️🤣
1/10/21, 12:49 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Glad I joined the call 🙏🏼. Anand Krishna very good plan

1/10/21, 1:37 PM - +1 (408) 396-9658: Every social media now says accessing all info and seems like not much differences what app u r using . But again it would be a collective decision.
1/10/21, 1:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-7783: Wow! So much so WhatsApp claiming that they will share with Insta and FB... Thanks Anand bhai for the call... Will wait for the survey...

1/10/21, 1:47 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Why is signal completely ruled out?
1/10/21, 1:47 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: Hahaha! Completed! Though, why no option for signal

1/10/21, 1:48 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Voted for telegram, but will prefer signal

1/10/21, 1:51 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I read somewhere that signal doesn't have group limits
1/10/21, 1:52 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Are we sure?
1/10/21, 1:52 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: i think there should be 3rd option (  Fine with any or something ) 😊

1/10/21, 1:54 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: We may need to a trail before switching
1/10/21, 1:54 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It is not possible to exploit it for ads targeting or data harvesting

1/10/21, 1:57 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: Done.
1/10/21, 1:57 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Conclusion of the discussion is - security is not the issue right now. It is all about size limit of the group as whatsapp only allows 257 max. 
So, survey is identify non-active participants and cleanup to make more room in this group.
Also, Signal is still not as mature as whatsapp and telegram. So, going to Signal right now is not the good option.
1/10/21, 1:57 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: WhatsApp is on the lead by a wide margin!

1/10/21, 2:06 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: Whatsapp winning by almost 💯%
1/10/21, 2:07 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: We should keep doing this survey every 15 days, till eaither signal or telegram wins
1/10/21, 2:07 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: 😁
1/10/21, 2:07 PM - +1 (775) 338-8162: Done. Thanks for organizing it.
1/10/21, 2:08 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Spoke to Anand and the key take away was the focus on finding talent and grow irrespective of the size. Please make your voice heard by voting. Also folks who are not interested or not using this group actively can do a favour by leaving and making room for others 🙏
1/10/21, 2:08 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: 😆🤣👏
1/10/21, 2:09 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: WhatsApp may increase group numbers due to competition

1/10/21, 2:19 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Really not making a strong argument of non-profit there when the founder is literally same dude as WhatsApp founder. See it in 3 more years where it goes (with your data).
(Again, because I think privacy is illusion, I’m happy to move whoever we decide. I just don’t see a point to.)
1/10/21, 2:21 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Remember, nothing comes free in this materialist world, you make yourself free for them 🙏🏽

All are here to use our data in some or other way
1/10/21, 2:22 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Given that it is open source project, if anyone tries to take it private, one can easily fork signal 2.0 and continue. It is strong argument in favor of signal.
1/10/21, 2:23 PM - +1 (201) 268-4316: Done
1/10/21, 2:23 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Nope. That is not true. There are lot of generous give aways.
1/10/21, 2:23 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Exactly. And even if you conceptualize a service for free initially, the economics will never ever work.
Believe me I am a Gujju. Off all I’d love to get stuff for free and I HATE to share my data. But!
1/10/21, 2:24 PM - +1 (860) 839-6893: Done
1/10/21, 2:24 PM - +1 (847) 525-3394: Done
1/10/21, 2:25 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I agree but who will go for a Signal 2.0 maintained by a dude in his garage with no money to host servers asking for donations like Wikipedia ... versus a rich in services, well integrative environment of purchased Signal 1.0?
1/10/21, 2:25 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Not by American corporations though 🙏🏽
1/10/21, 2:26 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Just think about it.
Only corporations who fund tobacco research are tobacco companies....
The NRA funds gun studies....
And so on.
So yes of course somebody will fund something. But who will fund and what will he get in return?
1/10/21, 2:26 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Bitcoin was the biggest giveaway. Don't know if satoshi nakamoto was american.
1/10/21, 2:28 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I think it is big plus. Eventually, all messaging will go decentralized. We are selecting best option right now.
1/10/21, 2:28 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Are you really saying that “brothers go to Signal I promise it will remain fully free and never snoop on your data perpetually and somehow fund millions to run thousands of computers FOR YOU”.
Really ?
1/10/21, 2:28 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: one one more thing. please give the same name in your survey participation time which you have on your whatsapp profile else I'll not be able to relate. Thanks.
1/10/21, 2:28 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I understand what u mean.
1/10/21, 2:28 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Where did I say that?
1/10/21, 2:29 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Aw snaps! The Tom Hanks is me 😃 just kidding
1/10/21, 2:29 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Anyways, looking at voting, we are staying on whatsapp
1/10/21, 2:29 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Anand bhai.. Seema there are two vaibhav... so consider both because I certainly voted only once...🙂
1/10/21, 2:29 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: When you said Bitcoin was given away tech. I am try to draw your analogy.
(I am not biasing or upset. Just trying to learn)
1/10/21, 2:30 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It's better to continue using whatsapp till we have majority consensus about moving anywhere.
1/10/21, 2:30 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Let's stay together. If all we are going to do is discussing stocks, facebook won't get much out of us.
1/10/21, 2:31 PM - +1 (609) 442-9779: Done
1/10/21, 2:31 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I had same opinion voiced in my write up.
But my reasoning was - already shared data with WhatsApp and Facebook a lot. Let’s not share with more. Also it’s hard to relocate our entire social life (mom pop and uncles).
I also said stop thinking internet should be free. Millions of servers do have a cost to run for last 30 years
1/10/21, 2:34 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: This message was deleted
1/10/21, 2:34 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Ofcourse it is not going to be free. But cost benefit should always be calculated. Privacy is important aspect of freedom. Freedom has no pricem
1/10/21, 2:35 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: In true decentralized social network, we will have to host our own data, and also pay for fetching feeds of other data.
1/10/21, 2:36 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: But you will have complete control on your data.
1/10/21, 2:36 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: No one will be able to censor you.
1/10/21, 2:36 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Fully agree
1/10/21, 2:36 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I actually prefer it to make money and py for all this rather than having my birthdate and gender id stolen
1/10/21, 2:37 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: This is a good article by Ratan Sharda. Pls take out time to read

https://kreately.in/deplatforming-trump-is-not-about-right-or-left/
1/10/21, 2:37 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: You will be able to sell your data in proper way, and you will get paid rather than Facebook.
1/10/21, 2:37 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Imagine not being bombarded with pointless ads - I already purchased shoes last week and Amazon and google still keep showing me cuz of cookies
1/10/21, 2:37 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Also.
1/10/21, 2:37 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: I feel social corps will move to that in very short time
1/10/21, 2:38 PM - Niteen: <Media omitted>
1/10/21, 2:38 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: So economics will work out with decentralized networks, once you overcome setup hump 🐫.
1/10/21, 2:39 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: 3 variants of Facebook: free, paid and paid but discounted with data coupons (can’t be free still)

1/10/21, 2:40 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Aur fir legislators bhi hai na uske pichhe
1/10/21, 2:41 PM - +1 (224) 600-8667: Done
1/10/21, 2:41 PM - +1 (732) 692-0317: Done ✅
1/10/21, 2:41 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Every day I also wake up annoyed that my privacy is gone. But I call it “given up” not “stolen”. I signed up their contract!
1/10/21, 2:41 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Current business model maximizes revenue.
1/10/21, 2:43 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: @17325013097 even if voting favors WhatsApp, I still feel moving to telegram is net-gain at no loss. No group limit of 257 means there’s no loss all gain. Just a thought.
1/10/21, 2:43 PM - +1 (732) 277-7743: Done
1/10/21, 2:44 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: That’s true. Unless legislators steal his thunder somehow and then his revenue falls below what a smaller paid model would yield?

Recall the 2 billion Fb was fined that spanked their bottom line a year ago?
1/10/21, 2:45 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: My only worry is one thief stole my data already. I just don’t want new new thief’s
1/10/21, 2:45 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Along with data, major threat is censorship
1/10/21, 2:46 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: (Amazon has my wifi password and voice, google has my voice and location, so does fb and so on.. why others)
1/10/21, 2:46 PM - +1 (631) 429-6726: 👍
1/10/21, 2:46 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Censorship is a huge but disjoint argument.
1/10/21, 2:47 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: You see anything super-far reaching should be scrutinized (not controlled but at least watched). Cuz it has potential to disrupt and harm real society so it’s gov job to watch it a bit
1/10/21, 2:47 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Zuck, jack, google sleepyheads and Bezos are now kings of the internet. We are at their mercy till we keep using their services. Sooner or later, we will have to figure the way out
1/10/21, 2:47 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: If we don’t watch it then 15 guys in Palo Alto cubicle can trigger riot in the real world
1/10/21, 2:48 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: This is also disjoint argument.
1/10/21, 2:48 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: 15 guys can also coordinate riot planning on zoom call
1/10/21, 2:48 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Or can just meet in park and plan it
1/10/21, 2:49 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Arguments like "it will be used by terrorist", "it will be used for drugs or child porn" are weak arguments and helps zuck coterie maintain control of internet
1/10/21, 2:50 PM - +1 (201) 268-4316: Kya bol diya Sachin bhai 😀
1/10/21, 2:50 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: No - Economics won’t work.

When I tried to answer my own questions, I grudgingly felt that I should stay put on WhatsApp. Or, we should get in a habit to pay a monthly fee to Facebook (remember, grudgingly), or we should deploy our own servers and host personally built social apps, at home. But, those will still not be free. Ponder over these points and make your own call.
1/10/21, 2:51 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Small scale hoga.
Social media - huge scale
1/10/21, 2:51 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: If economics works for facebook, it will work even better when done individually.
1/10/21, 2:51 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: How can we run servers and provide gestures and maintenance?
1/10/21, 2:52 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Think of this - “in line reply feature”
1/10/21, 2:52 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: You’d have to implement from scratch then deploy do AB testing etc
1/10/21, 2:52 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: You already have server. Your phone is good enough to act as server.
1/10/21, 2:52 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: All that will cost YOU for your social circles to use
1/10/21, 2:52 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Bhai, let's take it offline.
1/10/21, 2:52 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: What about data charge and power
1/10/21, 2:53 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: Bhai sorry to you and ALL :)

1/10/21, 2:55 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Significant development happening with Tesla. I think it is still a great buy at this price.
1/10/21, 2:56 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Tesla will come with technologies that will supersede all in the market. Non car ones
1/10/21, 2:56 PM - +1 (201) 208-1249: I actually bought some put on MARA after that discussion.

1/10/21, 3:05 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Don’t feel bad if we missed any. Feel good that we are together to share, learn and grow.
1/10/21, 3:05 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: We have to share our best and help. That’s the mantra for us to succeed
1/10/21, 3:05 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I have one subscription, similarly you guys have another. Let’s use those for analysis and discussions

1/10/21, 3:41 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: it went from 1.51 to 28.50

these corrections are healthy 

i am looking at mara around 40/50 before march earnings
1/10/21, 3:41 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: More than majority for WhatsApp!
1/10/21, 3:42 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: mara went from

0.33 to 5 

5 to 7

7 to 15

15 to 29
1/10/21, 3:42 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Same with btc went in a straight line from 17 to 42. Its healthy to have correction for another leg up
1/10/21, 3:42 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: 👍
1/10/21, 3:54 PM - +1 (205) 535-5323: Did we just miss btc? It fell down to 34k range and quickly gone up to 37k
1/10/21, 3:54 PM - +1 (205) 535-5323: I was thinking to add up more on 35k range
1/10/21, 3:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Deepak mentioned about Hive earlier. Lets throw some numbers. Speculative but has the potential to go around $13 before end of year.
1/10/21, 3:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
1/10/21, 3:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Possible that btc just made a quick run to the blue line and reversed.

1/10/21, 6:08 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: It has some room to catch up with other miners

1/10/21, 6:12 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: ARBKF is another one uk based
1/10/21, 6:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I like what you did here. One should also consider that U has a duopoly and other optionality in AR/VR so the get few points here. Skillz is early in the game in a niche and growing much faster. The business model is also somewhat different with Skillz has a lot to prove. U had already proved itself as the go the game engine for roughly half of worlds developers. 

Depending on each individual risk profile, there can be a place for both companies in investors portfolio. However, I agree that Skilz will likely outperform in the long run.  Long Skillz at $12.5
1/10/21, 6:21 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Valuation Disparity

U currently 800M in revenue.
SKLZ currently 250M in revenue.

250/800 = .31 or 31%

So SKLZ should be valued at 31% of U's current market cap based on total revenue.

U current market cap 45B

45(.31) = gives us SKLZ market cap with U's valuation... 14.06B

SKLZ current market cap... only 7B @ $20

14/7 = 2

We need to multiply the current share price by 2 to get to a 14B market cap.

2($20) = $40

So if SKLZ is just valued like it's peers, it's ALREADY a $40 stock WITHOUT the 100%+ growth they will experience over the next 24 months.
1/10/21, 6:21 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Sorry I had to make some changes
1/10/21, 6:22 PM - +1 (408) 306-8501: Satish Sarepella.vcf (file attached)

1/10/21, 6:23 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I did not cover a lot of inticracies but a short summary is here.
1/10/21, 6:25 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I'm long at $19.5
1/10/21, 6:36 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/cramers-lightning-round-buy-alibaba.html
1/10/21, 6:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Revenue estimated to grow around 50% from current annualized revenue of $240MM in 2021, which may prove out to be conservative, if folks stay home longer. This puts the forward revenue multiple at <15x. Roblox will come in at least 2-3x multiple of Sklz. 

If this beats, which I think they will, Mr. market will soon realize that multiple  expansion is needed here on top of nominal revenue growth.
1/10/21, 6:47 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: In terms of portfolio allocation percentage when buying a stock i always have this doubt. Is it fair to allocate equal percentage to small caps vs large caps or too risky. Ex- SKLZ and AAPL ?
1/10/21, 6:50 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Depending on where you are in the risk cycle. I keep more allocation to small/mid cap in a strong bull market, vs reduce in chop shot maeket that is prior to a major risk event (Sept/Oct preceding elections).
1/10/21, 6:51 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Multiple upto 15! Damn!
1/10/21, 6:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am currently overweight riskier stock like Skillz given my bias for 2021. I understand that there will be pullbacks which will be an opportunity to buy vs sell.
1/10/21, 6:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: However, if you want to avoid the headache and want to buy and forget, it may be prudent to have more allocation to Apple like stocks.
1/10/21, 6:53 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: makes sense, thanks Nash
1/10/21, 6:54 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You are welcome 👍
1/10/21, 7:02 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: I am closely monitoring Unity(U), could you please suggest me when shall I enter?
I am well aware of power of Unity like gaming and visualization. Even my team is working on Unity.
I am sure it will do well in future too but not sure when to enter.
1/10/21, 7:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I like the current price falling 23% from top and seeing a day of rally. You can offcourse position size and buy more if it falls further, but I doubt if market remains supportive.
1/10/21, 7:18 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: Thanks Nash!👍👍👍
 Let me think.
1/10/21, 7:59 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I do have a few apple
1/10/21, 10:26 PM - +1 (205) 535-5323: BTC is nearing 35k range, if anyone is looking to add more
1/10/21, 10:30 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Here are the levels (aggressive to conservative) $33.3k, $30k, $24.5 and $20k
1/10/21, 10:30 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: 😲
1/10/21, 10:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: FYI - I am in the conservative camp, and interested in the last 2 nos, may or may not nibble around $30k if it goes there.
1/10/21, 10:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Seems like approaching my first number
1/10/21, 10:39 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Nash- in simple terms what is the fundamental support for Bitcoin valuation when none of the big countries and governments are supporting it?
1/10/21, 10:39 PM - +1 (732) 902-1408: For a change guys watch the test match ....what a roller coaster.....,,ind chasing 408 to win on 5th day......pant made brilliant 97 in 118 balls and put in winning chance.....still long way to go need another 135
1/10/21, 10:39 PM - +1 (732) 902-1408: Ups pujara out? Now it is difficult
1/10/21, 10:39 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: For my understanding.. want to know
1/10/21, 10:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: When BTC becomes the default medium of exchange as it has been in some crisis prone countries which have experienced significant devaluation, it will not stay at this level.
1/10/21, 10:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: As of now, the main thesis is around a store of value aka digital gold.
1/10/21, 10:42 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍
1/10/21, 10:42 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: So the current basis is economies like Venezuela and zimbabwe... where you are hedging against gold... in this case BTC...👍👍
1/10/21, 10:44 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: The reason I keep wondering on BTC is.. why wud the big economies move away from the power they have on their currency.. say US... all said and done all it takes Fed to print 100 $ bill is that currency paper.. and it circulates around the world- not even raising internal inflation.. they wud never support BTC where they have to share power
1/10/21, 10:45 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep, it's seen as an assymetric and uncorrected asset class (though I dont fully agree) with positively skewed return because of its deflationary characteristics.
1/10/21, 10:45 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: Anyone following ILMN. A bio technology company in geno sequencing.
1/10/21, 10:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: No economy wants to move away from its reserve currency, but there may be a time that a severe debt crisis may spiral into something big that citizens would tend to a rule based system, rather than a US dollar bill that depreciates in value every year.
1/10/21, 10:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: *tend to put faith in
1/10/21, 10:48 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I am. I think it’s a good share to have.
1/10/21, 10:49 PM - +1 (732) 902-1408: Well.....as long as oil is traded in USD .....and dependency on oil goes down considerably think USD willl still be global currency ....
1/10/21, 10:49 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: thanks👍👍
1/10/21, 10:51 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: Yes I think holding for long term will create multi fold wealth from this level also.
1/10/21, 10:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Nothing happening to USD for a long time. But as China becomes powerful and work towards its aspiration of being #1 economy, they may be a tug of currency war with US. A niche may develop in certain pockets of the world who may support bitcoin as an alternative.
1/10/21, 10:58 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Do you follow Jeff Brown?
1/10/21, 10:59 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Excellent analysis 🙏🏽 with all the helicopter 🚁 money pouring in by FED, there is a huge possibility.
1/10/21, 11:00 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: That wud be the best case scenario for BTC... a currency war between usd and yuan...and that’s where all will rush to hedge more
1/10/21, 11:00 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Huge amount of $ for COVID relief to people <75K went to stocks
1/10/21, 11:02 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: Yes I recently started to read about it. Some of his videos were going round which I watched recently. Got the hint from there 😁. Did some reading after that .
1/10/21, 11:03 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I used to own it and consider it as an ok large cap stock to gain exposure to Genomic sequencing field.
1/10/21, 11:04 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: Do you ? His readings seems interesting.
1/10/21, 11:04 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Means now exited? No more in your recommendations?
1/10/21, 11:04 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Any specific reason for your exit? It will help us in deciding if we should enter n
1/10/21, 11:05 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Haha
1/10/21, 11:09 PM - +1 (917) 862-4382: Kal BTC related stock ki pitas hogi.
1/10/21, 11:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I never recommended this stock. Few reasons 1) Lackluster revenue growth 2) Other competitors who are more agile and doing similar work in the field 3)  stock has done nothing since 2018, in a big consolidation. 

There is some revenue growth coming in next year, so one can play it short term, may perform OK in the long term.
1/10/21, 11:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The low was $33.4k, $100 off from my number before it bounced off. Not out of the woods in my opinion though. Let's rebook at it again tomorrow. Good night

PSA: Questions about WhatsApp?

After responding to a few hundred relatives and friends, figured it might be easier to broadcast responses to these frequently asked questions about the WhatsApp policy changes here.

Short version: your personal conversations remain personal and encrypted. WhatsApp’s data sharing hasn’t really changed, its security hasn’t changed, it remains the largest end-to-end encrypted platform available.

Long version:
Keeping aside any jokes on what valuable or secret data you are really trying to protect...

1. WhatsApp is still end to end encrypted, which means that ALL your chat threads (group or 1:1) as well as your voice/video calls are entirely secure and only available to you and the people you are talking to. Yes, that includes all your naughty content too.

2. Your contact list on the phone that you use for looking up contacts and sending messages to/calling people, is not shared with anyone, including Facebook.

3. The only time you have to worry about your data “leaking” is when you backup your WhatsApp messages to iCloud (if you are on iPhone) or equivalent Android backup service. To be able to restore that data on a new device, the backup file is not encrypted. So please protect your iCloud backups well.

4. So what are the real changes? **In future** IF and WHEN you start using WhatsApp to send messages to businesses or do payment transactions, the shopping data can be shared  with merchants and Facebook to improve their services (example making your Ads more personalized for you). When in future will this happen? Your guess is as good as mine...

5. If nothing really has changed, why all this noise? Or a more candid version of this - why can’t WhatsApp explain this in simple language? WhatsApp over-communicates and proactively shares even the slightest change that might impact its extremely high standards on privacy to run an end to end encrypted private messaging service for 2 Billion people. Good learning for us that technically nuanced and accurate messaging doesn’t work at 2B people scale.

6. Can you give feedback to the WhatsApp team about this? Absolutely. See a more detailed response from the head of WhatsApp: https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1347660768225841152...

7. Do I need to pay for a private/secure version of WhatsApp? Heck no. Please don’t fall for any such scams. There is only one secure, private version of WhatsApp and that is FREE for all the 2 billion people who use it. If you still feel like spending money, I’ll send you my Venmo account to transfer money to.

8. Can I stop freaking out now? Yes please and I’d like to go back and sleep as well. 

And yes, feel free to forward this to your friends and family. I won’t charge any fees nor send your data to Facebook 😉

1/11/21, 11:40 AM - +1 (732) 762-4064: What will be the good price enter?
1/11/21, 11:41 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The ranges are above. $29-$30 could be good support for a nibble, but you can aggressively increase your position if it goes to my next target
1/11/21, 11:42 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And next
1/11/21, 11:42 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Position sizing, the lower it goes the more u buy

1/11/21, 11:50 AM - +1 (205) 535-5323: I added at 35 and 33 😢 but it was a very small(still green overall). Glad I did not add much . I’ll now hold off onto adding more, just wait for 20-25 k range.
1/11/21, 11:54 AM - +1 (205) 535-5323: I think this dip is healthy as the run was exponential very quick .
1/11/21, 12:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Took an initial position at $2
1/11/21, 12:19 PM - Lalmani BJANA: what is the ticker for Hive? looks like not available on RH

1/11/21, 1:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Here, it's a speculative position and should be treated as such
1/11/21, 1:16 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: You were spot on as always Nash, hit another home run with GRGW today, took out my principle left the house money to grow in the stock.
1/11/21, 1:18 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: If crossed 2.11, it will possibly be a breakout
1/11/21, 1:18 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: *crosses
1/11/21, 1:19 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: This might be a multibagger for us if we take the risk and hold it for a while, m willing to take my chances on this one and hold it for some time to see where it goes.
1/11/21, 1:21 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Irrespective of the huge rally it has gone through in last few days, if any one of the rumours about the announcement becomes true, this will shoot up again, i might be wrong though.
1/11/21, 1:21 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Patience is the key 👍🏽

1/11/21, 2:24 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: @12015655130 - Any guidance on Zoom, should we add, it is consolidating at the current levels for quite sometime now.
1/11/21, 2:26 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: If it crosses our average buying then we will lose the gains of adding the stock at a lower price😜

1/11/21, 3:06 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Qs- in between started some recovery last week.. but now again slipping
1/11/21, 3:06 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Is it to hold.. or is too long a shot to really be a multi bagger for now?
1/11/21, 3:11 PM - +1 (205) 535-5323: I am using motley’s basic subscription for last 2 years. Mostly there recommendations got profits for me. Okta was the first on my portfolio which is a multi bagger for me. But I am not able to invest in all of them what they recommend because of small capital.
1/11/21, 3:14 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: LMND was my first purchase from their recommendation in December, am almost at 100% gain, will follow them more religiously in future.
1/11/21, 3:16 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 10-12% gain is too less for me, m greedy 😜😜
1/11/21, 3:17 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: No what I mean is, it is slightly down so a new entry can be made in it.
I am thinking to enter.
1/11/21, 3:20 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👌
1/11/21, 3:22 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Their recommendations are good. Only one that didn’t work well for me was NBIX. Rest yielded good returns.

1/11/21, 3:24 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I can only relate with name.
1/11/21, 3:27 PM - +1 (205) 535-5323: The one I am using is basic subscription$199(but they give for $99 for promotion first time) , they have next level subscriptions which are very costly (worth only if capital is atleast quarter million +) 😱
1/11/21, 3:28 PM - +1 (716) 352-5996: Same here. Have bee using basic subscription and blindly following them from last 6 months. So far 20+% return. Fvrr pins lmnd are biggest winners. Few losers as well.
1/11/21, 3:30 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: They keep spamming me everyday to get the subscription for $49 for a year. I think I'll get it. Does anyone want to split it with me? I don't know if splitting that is a good idea or not.
1/11/21, 3:30 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: This is for Motley Fool
1/11/21, 3:32 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Can we discuss the Mootley recommendations in this group for everyone’s benefit and faster wealth creation! 
To start with, We can just put the stock names and our initial analysis on the company, if any.
1/11/21, 3:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's a paid service. I don't think it's a good idea.
1/11/21, 3:34 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Particularly as whatsapp is watching now 😉
1/11/21, 3:34 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Not sure if I understood Nash.
1/11/21, 3:34 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: I agree
1/11/21, 3:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's a subscription based service. You pay for it and not others, so its essentially a violation if you discuss what they discussed with you
1/11/21, 3:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The cost is not that much, if people are interested.
1/11/21, 3:36 PM - +1 (205) 535-5323: Yeah I fear that too
1/11/21, 3:36 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I was thinking of not telling them about it😜😜, just joking.
1/11/21, 3:36 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Deleted the stock list
1/11/21, 3:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You can pick up a motley fool stock though, do your own research and not tell that its a MD stock, which is difdeeent
1/11/21, 3:37 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Got you👍
1/11/21, 3:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: For people who like MF stocks, they can simply go to MFAM website and look at their mutual fund for free
1/11/21, 3:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They have top 100 which lists the top 100 large cap ideas
1/11/21, 3:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: That produced 40% return last year, which is pretty good vs S&P.
1/11/21, 3:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I know it, because I like to compare my performance wand beat MF and IBDs of the world.
1/11/21, 3:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: IBD 50 generated a 17% return last year.
1/11/21, 3:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: S&P was 16%
1/11/21, 3:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I still think it's weak on the chart side, but getting attractive from valuation perspective. I plan to buy between 300-326 or before their earnings.
1/11/21, 3:42 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Do you have both IBD AND MOTLEY?
1/11/21, 3:42 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: No data is free
1/11/21, 3:42 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash, I will wait as well.
1/11/21, 3:42 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I don't have it
1/11/21, 3:43 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Ok
1/11/21, 3:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Motley fool asset management

1/11/21, 3:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You can follow their highest conviction ideas for free
1/11/21, 3:43 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: oh ok
1/11/21, 3:43 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: How?
1/11/21, 3:44 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I think you just recommend but don't tell name of them...
1/11/21, 3:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
1/11/21, 3:45 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Interesting
1/11/21, 3:45 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Just look at the following funds. Every stock in it is a MF recommendation or directly buy it if easier
1/11/21, 3:45 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Don't forget to send me their $49 😋
1/11/21, 3:46 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Haha I enrolled earlier but cancelled their subscription
1/11/21, 3:46 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: Now onwards whatever you share, we will understand where it is coming from 🤣🤣🤣🤣 we are not "fool" 

Keep sharing your 💡
1/11/21, 3:47 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: I also burnt my hand on Ragging bull subscription.. those guys were/ are fraud
1/11/21, 3:47 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I think we can give a name to that  🙂
1/11/21, 3:48 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: +1
1/11/21, 3:48 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: Patanjali Suggested
1/11/21, 3:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I admire MF. It's a good company and have generated some excellent ideas over the years. Their timing is not great though.
1/11/21, 3:48 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: I liked Adam Khoo course . It is costly buf good
1/11/21, 3:48 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: 🙏
1/11/21, 3:48 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: It is a course not alert system

1/11/21, 3:49 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Haha
1/11/21, 3:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I can do Adam Khoo for you for half the cost. I have beaten his account too. :-)
1/11/21, 3:50 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Oh nice
1/11/21, 3:50 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: So you also know him . What is your feedback about him?
1/11/21, 3:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I like MF better than Khoo.
1/11/21, 3:51 PM - +1 (646) 468-5061: Nash bhai ek subscription based service start kar do .. hamar bhi kuchh fayda ho jayega

1/11/21, 3:52 PM - +1 (205) 535-5323: Agree. They seem like wait for a company to establish well before they start recommending. Some recommendations 5x ed and some increased in double digit percents

1/11/21, 4:05 PM - +1 (205) 535-5323: When I started investing few years ago intention was to invest for long term. But over time realized to have multiple brokerage accounts each serve different purposes. Like long term, medium term(3-7) years and short term for some quick bucks. But it’s very difficult to manage all of them. This pandemic is giving time for this as of now, but once we get back to work at office location it will be a challenge

1/11/21, 4:08 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Wanted to share the long term perspective, this is a bit old but shows sp best and worst performers from 2009-2019
1/11/21, 4:09 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: The worst is 60% but look at best :)
1/11/21, 4:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Winners significantly outperform losers. If you are able to find a few good long term winners, it will not only pay for all the losers combined but create life changing wealth.
1/11/21, 4:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: A little over 25% return annualized will 10x your portfolio in 10 yrs
1/11/21, 4:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: That should be the goal
1/11/21, 4:14 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Nflx was a heck of a stock. Mfool is thriving on that still. I took their subscription for a short period and never saw any recommendation below 100$ some even going as high as 400$ whereas nflx and nvidia two of their winners were initially recommended under 10$
1/11/21, 4:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I know that folks are excited about a number of 100% homeruns in 2020, particularly because market had been kind. This is not easy to do on your entire portfolio for a very long period of time. Buffet and Lynch who have been able to do it are some of the best investors of all times.
1/11/21, 4:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah, we need to find stuff early in their S curve and not sell until it's peaked. Pretty confident that some of our stock will have the same S curve growth in years to come. Excited to see which ones.
1/11/21, 4:22 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Yeah basically with limited capital it becomes tricky sometimes to have a substanstial position for 100$ or above priced stocks.
1/11/21, 4:28 PM - +1 (201) 565-7161: one of analyst group suggesting... NIA suggests Blink Charging (BLNK) February 26, 2021 $50 put options currently trading for $10.47. We look for BLNK to crash to a price of between $10-$20 per share by the end of February and for these puts to rise to $30-$40.
1/11/21, 4:29 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: This year has been extraordinary..nothing that i have seen before. I don't think market will be so rewarding this year
1/11/21, 4:29 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Personally feel some sort of correction coming soon
1/11/21, 4:30 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Would like to understand it in little more detail Nash, as always have seen long time investors mention the same thing as you mentioned above-
 As per Rule of 72, I will double my investment in 3 years if my annual rate of return is 24%.

For example,how does it matter if on a 100k investment, how am I adding this 24k I mean by getting quick home  runs or by investing in long term or doing a mix and match.
I have the understanding that as long as I am adding 24k in the account I should be good, am I missing something here?
1/11/21, 4:33 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Let that sink in. Bitcoin was $100 off from my first level yesterday. I indicated that it should probably go to to the next level. Bitcoin made a low of $30,100 today, again $100 off from my 2nd level and bounced to $34.3k as of this writing. 

The structure looks good and there is reasonable probability that it may have bottomed (will know for sure in a day or 2). My order of $30,001 is still pending and I am kicking myself for being too picky. Sometine, you should just take it, a few percent here and there.
1/11/21, 4:34 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Really? Any reason for crash?
1/11/21, 4:35 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Can you give any reason for BLNK to move 400% in 3 months 😜
1/11/21, 4:36 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Doesn't mean it will crash
1/11/21, 4:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: For confirmation, I would like to see btc not close candles below 33.7k
1/11/21, 4:37 PM - +1 (205) 535-5323: Round figures like 30k, 35 k are psychological numbers. I have a buy at 30k as well. if it went below 30k it would have fallen more I guess.
1/11/21, 4:37 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Today’s market: NO LOGIC... Anything will happened.. May be BLNK touch $100 in 2 months or touch $10... you can’t find any reason
1/11/21, 4:38 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Use batane to de
1/11/21, 4:39 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: That's almost correct..only momentum up or down
1/11/21, 4:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's all support and resistance. The number was $30,100. $30,000 was not good enough
1/11/21, 4:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If it goes below $30k, you can look at my next support level
1/11/21, 4:41 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: 👍
1/11/21, 4:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-7161: Bhai... I got the email from analyst group with their suggestion, thought share with you guys. It may be helpful to someone. They did not provide much info... just two lines.. will share the details as I get.
1/11/21, 4:45 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Sure, good to know though.
1/11/21, 5:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's math and you can get to it anyway you like. Trading is inherently risky though and has an element of luck and market timing, so you need to do a lot of correct trades that goes in your favour vs those that does not.
1/11/21, 5:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Also if you earn 24 in year 1, year 2 should be invested 124 to get to100. The entire portfolio needs to be invested and generate that return vs individual stocks
1/11/21, 5:09 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Understood, and in term of long term investing, let’s say this is a high conviction business for me so I don’t book any profit and let it grow and hence I stay invested for 10 years. However, if the stock price doesn’t gain at the rate of 24% YoY on an average , I will not be able to 10x my money even after being invested for 10 years in that company.
I will be completely dependent of the stock price return.... which might fall later on, so at some point will have to book profit and move out...
1/11/21, 5:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Its all good qus. Let me wrap my work and I will respond
1/11/21, 5:11 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Sure take your time..... we all would like to be enlightened as always 😁
1/11/21, 5:14 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yepp this would be 24% on 124k in year 2 and 24% on 153k for year 3 to get near 200k after 3 years.
1/11/21, 5:17 PM - +1 (631) 429-6726: 👏🙏
1/11/21, 5:35 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: I thought we are talking about 24% YoY on the entire portfolio and keep rebalancing periodically btw winners and losers, also would like to see more light.

1/11/21, 6:08 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: A 67% voter turnout is marginally better than US elections, and we thought folks like this group. Seems like a lot of people are not interested in this group.
1/11/21, 6:10 PM - +1 (408) 396-9658: I can see couple of names are duplicate , not sure if same name we have more than one or ?????
1/11/21, 6:10 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: Yup! I am sure all are interested, speaking for myself - this is my favorite WhatsApp group as I actually make (sometimes lose) money from info/knowledge sharing from this group. Just that - I would have preferred signal over WhatsApp as a lot of my groups are moving there. That’s all!
1/11/21, 6:11 PM - +1 (732) 331-3713: Do not start that fiasco 😝😝😝
1/11/21, 6:13 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: someone voted with name Whatsapp...hard to identify who did.

1/11/21, 7:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I think there is a confusing in the definition of "long term". Long term does not mean to marry a stock, rather than vet it  every quarter to see if it's in the path of sustained growth that you expected for it. Its a important exercise to look at the numbers, see management interests are aligned and they are doing what they said they will do. It's hard for a stock that continuously beat expectation, and show positive growth q/q and y/y to underperform over the long term. It may for a little if market participants punish it due to overvaluation, and exactly that is when one should buy again. 

Manik showed 65x (every 1,000 goes to 67,000) growth in Netflix. That would have not been possible if you would have tried to market time it. It was stupid to sell Netflix anytime over the last 10 yrs, and one would know this if they read the quarterly earnings script religiously. In other words, Netflix would have paid for 100's of other $1,000 investments that lost half their value. Just think about that.
1/11/21, 7:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 65,000
1/11/21, 7:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So, if you find a long term winner, do not part ways with it. You may sell a portion of it, due to overvaluation as I did for TTD around $900, but I still have a large portion in it that I plan to ride for a long time.

Assuming there is $250 difference between two exchanges, an arbitrageur  may buy in one exchange and sell in other until the price coincides. To get correct indicators, one can only look at the chart of the exchange where you are actively trading.

1/11/21, 9:07 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: buy before ex-dividend date and then you sell after record date. however the stock price gets adjusted for the dividend and taxes may also differ for short term. so ideally within 3 days you can do all the transaction for dividend stocks, but check if numbers makes sense.

Now what
The pet market is surging during the pandemic, as work-from-home arrangements allow more people to adopt cats and dogs. Spending on pets, including food and veterinary care, reached a new high of $99 billion in the U.S. alone in 2020, according to the American Pet Products Association. *Within this massive market, spending on diagnostic care is forecasted to rise from $1.7 billion in 2019 to $2.8 billion in 2024* 

To meet the expected strong demand for its new diagnostic platform, *Zomedica is ramping up its sales capabilities ahead of Truforma's upcoming commercial launch* Notably, Zomedica has made Truforma capable of being installed remotely, which should help to boost sales, by making installations easier and safer during the COVID-19 crisis.

1/12/21, 7:10 AM - +1 (201) 565-7161: Yesterday at 3PMEST, NIA suggested Blink Charging (BLNK) February 26th $50 put options. The first trade for this contract following NIA's alert was at $9.80 so we are going to use that price as our official suggestion price. NIA's BLNK put option suggestion rallied to a closing price of $10.50 after trading a total of 210 contracts during yesterday's final hour of trading.

The market share leader of the EV charging industry is ChargePoint, which is currently in the process of merging into a SPAC called Switchback Energy Acquisition (SBE). The deal will close on February 11th and ChargePoint will begin trading that day under a new symbol. ChargePoint post merger will have 306 million shares outstanding. Based on SBE's closing price yesterday of $42.51 per share, ChargePoint will have a market cap of $13 BILLION. In 2020, ChargePoint generated revenue of $144.515 million for growth of 57% over 2019 revenue of $92.03 million. ChargePoint will be worth an estimated 90X revenue.

BLNK has current trailing twelve month revenue of $4.478 million. Exactly five years ago, BLNK had trailing twelve month revenue of $3.842 million. BLNK has only managed to achieve total revenue growth over a period of FIVE YEARS of 16.55% vs. ChargePoint's revenue growth of 57% last year alone!

On Google Play, ChargePoint's mobile app has a very positive average rating of 4.6 stars: click here to see.

On Google Play, BLNK's mobile app has an extremely negative average rating of 2.3 stars: click here to see.

BLNK's average rating is HALF the average rating of ChargePoint, because everybody says that BLNK's chargers are extremely slow and many of them are completely broken!

If we IGNORE all of these facts and pretend that BLNK deserves to trade at the same multiple as ChargePoint of 90X revenue, this would only value BLNK at $405 million. Prior to BLNK's registered public offering announced on Friday, it had 35.95 million shares outstanding. A $405 million market cap would value BLNK at $11.27 per share. This means BLNK needs to crash by 78.32% for it to match the same multiple that ChargePoint will trade at!

Today, BLNK will be closing on its registered public offering, selling 5.4 million shares at $41 per share or a 21.15% discount to yesterday's closing price. The company will receive net proceeds of $211.2 million in cash, but its shares outstanding will increase to 41,610,025. BLNK's CEO is personally selling 540,000 of his own shares in this offering!

BLNK's post offering market cap at $52 per share will be $2.164 BILLION or 483X revenue! We have never encountered a bigger put option opportunity in our lives!

1/12/21, 10:28 AM - +1 (862) 290-1331: A brief $NDRA DD.

Here's a penny that hasn't popped yet. 

“ENDRA Life Sciences develops medical imaging technology. It operates Thermo-Acoustic Enhanced UltraSound platform to enable clinicians to visualize human tissue composition, function and temperature.” —WSJ

Why am I looking at it?
It is currently trading around .87. 52 week low was .59 and high was 2.08. Price targets from analysts range from **3.50 to 6.00**. 

It recently gained **three buy ratings** from analysts that it did not possess three months ago. 

Trade **volume is double** what it usually is. 

Over the last 12 months, **insider ownership of NDRA has increased** by 700k shares. 

Their agreement with GE Healthcare was renewed as they expected. 

On December 15th, NDRA received a Chinese patent for their TAEUS liver device. But here’s why I care: “In the United States the parent application for the '062 patent has received a Notice of Allowance and is expected to issue **in the first quarter of 2021**, while a similar patent has already been issued in Europe as EP 3 294 142 B1.” (source: [https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/endra-life-sciences-granted-seventh-140000801.html](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/endra-life-sciences-granted-seventh-140000801.html))

It is only a matter of time for NDRA to get this **US patent**, and news of this could send shares through the roof. 

Currently in the **FDA review process** which normally takes 6 months or so. They filed in June 2020. (see “I'll wrap up the call before Q&A by emphasizing we're happy to deployed our first clinical system in the US and remain focused on ramping up commercialization activities in Europe, supporting the FDA review of our 510-K submission in the US and exploring partnerships in the pharmaceutical sector” in source above)

There financials aren’t great, but they're way better than some of the other companies we’ve looked at. They are **meeting the analysts’ earnings expectations** consistently (they were only down .02 in Q3). 

Low risk here. I think we’re seeing FDA and patent approval this month.

1/12/21, 1:37 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: MELI i purchased on a little high bt has been doing good still. Initial recommendation price was on 160 :(
1/12/21, 1:39 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Wow. That's over 10 times. Who recommended?
1/12/21, 1:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I also own Meli from $300, because you know that I don't see my winners ;-)
1/12/21, 1:40 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Chalo I also got some. Although I would have preferred to get it around .90 but had fomo lol
1/12/21, 1:40 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Could you through some light on MELI, is it good for long term hold from here?
1/12/21, 1:40 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: i know Nash started listening to you closely of late. i rem MELI when you advised 160 and SHOP at 150 :)
1/12/21, 1:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It is what Amazon does in North America, Sea does in Asia and Meli does in South America
1/12/21, 1:41 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: awesome concept, ecommerce
1/12/21, 1:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah and they also have a fintech platform like PayPal and they dominate that in that region.
1/12/21, 1:42 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: MELI is still 91B market cap, i think it shud grow, but not an expert on numbers
1/12/21, 1:42 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Amazon + PayPal @ 5% of their combined market cap.
1/12/21, 1:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah I averaged it as it went higher so my average cost is around 300
1/12/21, 1:44 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Amazing gains guys... 👍
1/12/21, 1:45 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: i rided the boat too late Biplab but now fully onboard :)

1/12/21, 1:49 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: SFIX is also good for long term.
1/12/21, 1:51 PM - +1 (973) 727-6428: Any suggestions on ticker BAND..good to buy? Down 20% from all time high..
1/12/21, 1:51 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks , could you highlight your bullish view on it
1/12/21, 1:53 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Where do you see its 20% down
1/12/21, 1:53 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Is it Bandwidth or some other
1/12/21, 1:54 PM - +1 (973) 727-6428: Hi sushant it is down 20% from all time high..today it was not down..
1/12/21, 1:54 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: I see, thanks Shiva
1/12/21, 1:55 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: I entered in FCEL 17C July 2021 expiry
1/12/21, 1:55 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Call in money?
1/12/21, 1:56 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Yes
1/12/21, 1:56 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: What your target?
1/12/21, 1:56 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: 17
1/12/21, 1:57 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Means what your target for this to go in 6 months?
1/12/21, 1:58 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Q: 17 in money have $7.20 and 14 in money $8.20. 
I think better to go 14?
1/12/21, 1:58 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Yes as of now my expiry is 7/16
1/12/21, 1:58 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Any reason to choose in money 17C
1/12/21, 1:59 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: 14C
1/12/21, 1:59 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Amazon is trying to copy their model. That’s enough for me to see the value of the model. Still couldn’t make any dent to SFIX sales.
1/12/21, 1:59 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Finally TTD is rallying
1/12/21, 1:59 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Yup
1/12/21, 1:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's has a solid CPaas platform at cost lower than my favorite Twilo
 I like Twilio because they have been executing and because Lawson is a visionary. However, if I find Band is eating its lunch, I may switch over. This is a solid company IMO.
1/12/21, 1:59 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Cool, is it a good entry price
1/12/21, 2:01 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Usually i play ITM or ATM unless i am very bullish and will play OTM
1/12/21, 2:02 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍
1/12/21, 2:02 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I was planning to add at 50, but it reversed the course at 56. 52week high is lower 70s.
1/12/21, 2:02 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Seems like it :-)
1/12/21, 2:02 PM - +1 (619) 573-3680: Any tips on risk management ?
1/12/21, 2:02 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: May be start with small position if you don’t have any. And average if it goes down. But I doubt if it reaches 50 level.
1/12/21, 2:03 PM - +1 (619) 573-3680: what is ur exit strategy when stock foes otherways ?
1/12/21, 2:03 PM - +1 (619) 573-3680: *goes

1/12/21, 2:08 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The current price is good for long term allocation. It may remain in chop shot though for sometime.

1/12/21, 3:47 PM - +1 (732) 857-9973: For FSLY any target in mind?
1/12/21, 3:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: No target. I like to continue to hold as long as they are executing.
1/12/21, 3:50 PM - +1 (201) 673-4866: Thanks. 👍
1/12/21, 3:51 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: That was exactly the view. I have many etfs in my retirement account that has value stocks including apple. For my other account I am playing more on growth.
1/12/21, 3:51 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Long term.
1/12/21, 3:52 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Keep adding.
1/12/21, 3:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I like cloudfare though more than fastly

1/12/21, 3:53 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Already have my full position.

1/12/21, 3:54 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: It went up to 110 and pulled back. I saw some positive stock momentum and thought of entering. Will see how it plays once’s crosses 110-115 level. Do you have any chart?
1/12/21, 3:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The chart looks good
1/12/21, 3:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You got it at the right time
1/12/21, 3:57 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Thats true most of the blue chips etf/funds have apple as their largest holding

1/12/21, 4:17 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Every single dollar should work towards compounding
1/12/21, 4:33 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If I was greedy, I should have been 200% invested after we were "out of woods" post Biden victory:-)
1/12/21, 4:38 PM - +1 (631) 429-6726: 😀😀
1/12/21, 4:41 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 😂😂 .... how much cash we should hold currently, m almost 90% invested.

1/12/21, 5:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Market is bullish no other way to think about it, I may target to add if it goes to 3600-3700, which is shallow move down from here
1/12/21, 5:03 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks 👍

Few I want to own- SE, Meli, twilio, Roku
1/12/21, 6:07 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I am sure still there would be more, which Nash can complete
1/12/21, 6:10 PM - +1 (419) 215-2329: I sold 50 15th jan calls one week before at some profit

1/12/21, 6:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I sold INAQ, don't own Bidu or Band. Biplab is correct on all the names. Some of the other ones missing that I had discussed here are Docusign, Adyen, roku, invitae, Datadog, cloudfare, fastly, peloton, pinterest, yolo, green thumb, curaleaf, draftking, bitcoin, ethereum and hive. 

The last 3 are swing positions to ride the crypto boom.
1/12/21, 6:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: May be I am missing some which will come out as results come out.

1/12/21, 7:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: This is coming tomorrow, led by PayPal co-founder Mark Levchin. Levchin, Thiel and Musk were the PayPal executives and originally known as PayPal Mafia. This company is a Buy now pay later platform, which enables digital and mobile commerce, and is the fastest growing segment in the payment industry. The company counts Shopify and Peloton as their top customer (Shopify is also an investor). Their plan is to disrupt the legacy credit card industry, and the way they have become preferred payment choice for millennial and Gen Z, it seems they have a long runway for growth.

Afterpay (Australian company) is a leader in this space which I own. I also plan to also get into Affirm in the future after the IPO pop settles. This is coming at $10bn valuation, but could be a $100bn company if they execute well and dominate the US market. Keep an eye on this :-)
1/12/21, 7:25 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Any recommendation to buy?
1/12/21, 7:27 PM - +1 (602) 451-9207: <Media omitted>
1/12/21, 7:27 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Risk is customer concentration. Peloton drives a lot of revenue. There will also be increased regulation as it becomes big, if we see how the Australian regulators are going after Afterpay.
1/12/21, 7:28 PM - +1 (310) 748-7761: 🙏🏻 thanks
1/12/21, 7:31 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I heard PayPal is also entering this “buy now pay later” model. Won’t it be a good idea to have PayPal stock as it is already in finance domain? It’s not like Amazon entering pharmacy. So I think PayPal is better than Affirm. What do you say?

1/12/21, 7:34 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I still own both, I guess you are mixing up with Snowflake which I sold at 375 and you sold a day prior to that.
1/12/21, 7:37 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I guess the price of the stock is immaterial as the gains are all in %age, one stock with price tag of 2k and 10 stock of $200, if both gains 10% it would be 2200 in both cases.
1/12/21, 7:39 PM - +1 (404) 904-7738: Bigger and better, but not a product? Cannot be a personnel issue then. Self driving car? The non-invasive blood glucose monitoring? A partnership with a biotech or insurer? The last one might be interesting.
1/12/21, 7:40 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Is after pay ticker APT.AX?

1/12/21, 8:30 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Great qus....Paypal will always be a solid company, but even if they go to BNPL, that will be a small part of their overall revenue stream, whereas Affirm which only specializes in this will grow 50-100% for years to come.

Also since we are looking at 10 baggers, it's difficult for $300 bn company to reach $3tn vs $10bn company to reach $100bn. Its risk vs reward, however if you want low volatility, PayPal is always a good option.

1/12/21, 9:36 PM - +91 98117 73057: What is Implied Volatility?
Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.
1/12/21, 9:50 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Nothing.. your trader will change the ticker and all, it might take a day or two though, this happened with me in case of the ticker “LCA” which got converted to “GNOG”

1/12/21, 10:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not sure what are you looking but its grown 1600% since March bottom. I got in $57.

Difficult to pick winners at this given this is such nascent industry. I will own both. I can compare the valuation after Affirm trades tomorrow.

1/12/21, 10:28 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Invest. But the number I see is different that yours. You entered at $57 and it grew 1600%. Does not match with the graph I see...I must be looking at wrong ticker.
1/12/21, 10:29 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Nope, it grew 1600% from march bottom, which I did not catch
1/12/21, 10:29 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I only got in at 57, and only up 50% 😔

On May 9th, 2019, FuelCell Energy (FCEL) performed a 1 for 12 reverse split. This means that shareholders will receive 1 share for every 12 shares they held in their account on the effective split date, May 9th, 2019.

1/13/21, 10:42 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The best time to buy is in order a) when I initially discuss it and it goes down at or below my discussed price b) when I first discuss it and it doesn't go down c) if later on at a higher price, it should only be bought on red days. It's a volatile stock so will give you opportunity as a minor retracement
1/13/21, 10:46 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I have my full position and I am not touching it. 25% up so far (average).

1/13/21, 12:11 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: This is no longer a Penny stock now, institutional investor are going to buy this stock for $3.38, it should only go up from here on. We should hold it, this might be a multi- bagger.

1/13/21, 12:50 PM - Niteen: 👍
1/13/21, 12:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Day 1 is not an issue, unless you are trading. Day 2 and for months later the price settle, most probably lower than your purchase price.

In case this gets FDA approval this would turn up big, I entered at .97 yesterday after Anand Patel recommended it.

1/13/21, 3:40 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: Intel is still the leader when it comes to server CPUs. Pat will ‘right size’ intel for sure. It’s a huge ship and he’ll (I am hoping) make it a much more lean machine!
1/13/21, 3:40 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: AMD > Intel (I couldn’t agree more)
1/13/21, 3:41 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: AMD is my favorite stock, coz I made the most money on AMD
1/13/21, 3:45 PM - +1 (573) 239-8625: Lisa Su deserves all the credit she got and more - she turned around AMD from a $3 stock in 2016 to a $90 one in 2021

1/13/21, 5:35 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: And in next 20 mins they will make $10-15M more. That’s the power of Money and how to play
1/13/21, 5:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I wish I could agree with you, but we will see a bubble this year.

1/13/21, 5:39 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: JAGX tanked 5% few mins back to 3.5 and now again going up to slowly. 

I’m pretty sure more investors took stake at <3.5 

Yesterday they took for 3.3
1/13/21, 5:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Get some ETH mate. Don't tell me later that I did not tell you
1/13/21, 5:40 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Something similar must have happened with OCGN today
1/13/21, 5:41 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: I have few , good to add more at this price ?
1/13/21, 5:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Should have done on red days (yesterday and day before)
1/13/21, 5:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: But not bad
1/13/21, 5:42 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: Any research on $NPA?

1/13/21, 5:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep
1/13/21, 5:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Thanks. Stripe is Adyens competitor, and will likely do well in the long run. I have to look at Financials though.
1/13/21, 5:54 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's already 30, 200% over their purchase price
1/13/21, 5:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Bill Ackman and Stripe magic I suppose
1/13/21, 6:21 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: I have not analyzed any of these but main objective of sharing is to get these in to everyone's attention. Experts may help provide their expert opinion based on their research. 👍🏻🙏🏻
1/13/21, 6:22 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Brilliant
1/13/21, 6:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Understood.
1/13/21, 6:27 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If someone can share a SPAC led by some of the popular figure like Ackman, Chamath, everyone can benefit. I may have a strategy that can generate triple digit return in a few months. Let me know if someone can diligently keep a track of this.
1/13/21, 6:33 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am looking to get information on SPAC the day they will start trading (announcement) or latest on Day 1. Let me know if someone can take a lead here

1/13/21, 7:14 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: PSTH starting price is 20 unlike the other SPACs
1/13/21, 7:15 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Also, as of now merging with Stripe rumors i think..nothing official yet
1/13/21, 7:17 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Lot of expectations from with PSTH as Bill Ackerman heading it
1/13/21, 7:18 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: I am waiting if it gets between 25 to 26 to enter

1/13/21, 7:51 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Basic Question- SPAC means one company Acquisition or merger with other , is that correct?

In this case BFT MERGING WITH paysafe?
1/13/21, 7:53 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Yea. But some info mentioned above is not correct. Verify before you act.
1/13/21, 7:56 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Thanks .. some trader says avoid trading during merger .. it might swing either way .. 


Is that a wrong strategy?
1/13/21, 7:57 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Let me know if I can be of any help.
1/13/21, 7:59 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: After merger SPACs have behaved differently..some shot up crazy and some gone down
1/13/21, 8:00 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Most of the SPACs i got in i take some profits before the merger
1/13/21, 8:01 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: What kind of help are you expecting here ? Can you elaborate more here ?
1/13/21, 8:03 PM - +1 (203) 482-3111: Thanks Nash. Please let me know if you are looking one more person. I am ready to help.
1/13/21, 8:05 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Unless the merger is confirmed and you are aware of the company, it is better to stay away.  As many people jumping without vetting the company, stock price is not a measure of the company performance. One has to analyze the financials.
1/13/21, 8:08 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: This is in reference to SPACs. SPACs are the new bubbles.

up 16% after hours
20% today in tradimg hours
1/13/21, 8:25 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I overlooked it. This one was unusual, as you know SPACs are typically issued  at $10
1/13/21, 8:26 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Count me in too, will need some direction though
1/13/21, 8:28 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Depending on which SPAC you are talking about. It's difficult to generalize. For eg, SNOW (which went the IPO route) after jumping 3x may be a bigger bubble, than some of the SPACs I have discussed.

1/13/21, 8:53 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: It takes time to turn a big ship. But I think they are realizing it. Investment in SNOW is an example.
1/13/21, 8:54 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Hope more will
Come in the way.
1/13/21, 8:54 PM - +1 (904) 487-2057: ARKX🚀🚀
1/13/21, 8:54 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Yes.  But you are right about almost everything.  Keep it going
1/13/21, 8:56 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It’s generally where folks invest their retirement funds, if some one has a MN dollar instead of putting to BRK he will chose to invest in ARK to get 25-30% returns.
It would make a huge difference for a 10 year duration, at least 3-4X.
1/13/21, 8:57 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Yup not trying to generalize all SPACs. If you don’t know the company before hand then they can get risky. Just because it’s a SPAC, jumping on it is not the right thing in my opinion. Not all SPACs are good.
1/13/21, 9:00 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Agreed on the growth part seeing the recent activity, but also need to take into account the risk factor. I am not sure if ppl would have same confidence putting retirement money in ARK vs BRK. I wont :)
1/13/21, 9:02 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yepp ARK will have to be very consistent with those returns for few more years for ppl to believe them with their retirement funds
1/13/21, 9:05 PM - +1 (972) 207-6100: Reuters: U.S. asks Tesla to recall 158,000 vehicles for touchscreen failures.

1/13/21, 9:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Thanks all for helping to pitch in. Since so many folks are interested lets talk about it here 

Since SPAC is a new vehicle for everyone, I haven't tried this strategy, but understand how this works. Lets talk about it. It is also a speculative strategy, so long term holders can ignore. 

All SPAC's are typically issued at $10 price (Now don't call on PSTH). Most companies also issue a warrant. A warrant is like a call option which allows you to buy the share at a predetermined price, the difference is it's directly from the company. 

Spac warrants trade along with the company on Day 1 and allows you to buy the SPAC at $11.5 (generally). So if you purchase the warrant early on at $2 on Day 1 and your exercise price is $11.5, your total cost is $13.5. 

SPAC typically take a couple of months to identify a deal. On the day of merger announcement, stock price may jump or may fall. So, it is extremely important to find a quality company backed by Class A sponsors.

Lets take the example of IPOE. The stock traded at $10 in the first few days. On the day of announcement, the stock jump to around $20 (100% gain), the warrant jumped to $7.5 (400% gain in slightly over a month) 

So to sum up, warrants allows you to take leverage (like option) and allows for significant gains in this environment when IPO and SPAC market is really hot. 

What happens its a bad acquisition and the share price fall to $10, you can still exercise the share (if you think long term is good) and your loss be $10/$13.5 = 25%. Typically share would not fall below the purchase price of $10 (emphasis on the word typically), however if you identify top class sponsor and follow rumors, it's a very attractive risk adjusted return (25% loss versus triple digit gain).

What is the biggest risk? The SPAC sponsor cannot identify a deal and the warrant expire worthless. However it will be an embarrassment and cannot afford that. When Billionaires come in the market with announcement of SPAC, they most probably know the target. I expect Chamath, Ackman, Branson to close every deal they announce. 

Exercise of share: Most typically happens 30 day after close. However the strategy is to sell the warrant and not exercise. If you love company for the long term, you can exercise and hold for years. If you made an initial loss, you can still hold and let it recover. 

Questions?
1/13/21, 9:07 PM - +1 (860) 839-6893: Do you think it impacts tesla price tomorrow??
1/13/21, 9:08 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It came during after hours , there wasn’t much impact.
It seems nothing can bring down the mighty TSLA
1/13/21, 9:15 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks for the detailed write up Nash, what approach should we take to find a SPAC, from the list shared by Parag all the SPACs are way higher then 10 except NOVA, so shall we focus on that one for now?
1/13/21, 9:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Well, I have identified first SPAC, just completing final research. Sending soon.
1/13/21, 9:17 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Actually there is no ticker as NOVA
1/13/21, 9:18 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Great, what would be the next step for us to find more SPACs
1/13/21, 9:19 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Exercising the warrants most of them have lot of time..unless the merger deal has some specific condition
1/13/21, 9:20 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Just wanted to add some SPACS might sit close to 10 for lot of time..some times more than 6 months to identify the target company
1/13/21, 9:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah 5 yrs. Most companies also have clause that if share trade above $18 for 20 days out of 30, they will force you to exercise
1/13/21, 9:21 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: This happened to HYLN
1/13/21, 9:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They don't want you to hold for long, so the strategy is mostly to get out on Day 1
1/13/21, 9:22 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Which was not a good thing for HYLN
1/13/21, 9:22 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: @12015655130  any thoughts on haccu?
1/13/21, 9:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep watching it. Need to do more research
1/13/21, 9:23 PM - +1 (716) 352-5996: Thanks for sharing. 
Q: can these be traded normally like stocks or need to enable anything on trading platform
1/13/21, 9:23 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Let us know when you planning to buy
1/13/21, 9:23 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yes, your broker should allow you. Not sure if it's allowed in RH
1/13/21, 9:24 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: They are like regular stocks
1/13/21, 9:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I think I have identified our first warrant,  but want everyone to do further research in the next day or 2. These stuff are volatile, so no need to hurry. When we buy, we need to make sure that we are able to make profit out of it. 

VGAC/W - Trading at $2.60 as of now. Richard Branson is leading it, and we know he has an exceptional record of executing. Branson has made its intention very clear that he wants to compete with Tesla. It's an obvious vertical for him after dominating the sky with his airline and than Spacex. Branson has relationship with EV company Envision group who also owns a stake in SBE (chargepoint trading at $44). There is also rumor that Virgin may buy its rail company Virginia hyperloop.

I would look at the numbers over the next day or two, but also encourage everyone to look. This looks exciting as of now.
1/13/21, 9:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: VGAC shares at $11.68
1/13/21, 10:05 PM - +1 (775) 338-8162: These were some spacs discussed highly off by my friends - VGAC, IPOD, IPOF, APXT, FIII, CCIV......for reference
1/13/21, 10:06 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It seems that it has either already crossed 30 days or is about to complete it.
1/13/21, 10:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 30 day after the deal announcement.
1/13/21, 10:10 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Got it.
1/13/21, 10:11 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There will be a spike in price like affirm today once the announce. We want to frontrun that announcement.
1/13/21, 10:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I will check but look at the warrant price also. We need to be closer to $2-$3 mark to generate a good profit.
1/13/21, 10:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The earlier we identify a deal, cheaper the warrant price
1/13/21, 10:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Lets find out IPOG trading date.
1/13/21, 10:14 PM - +1 (917) 584-6536: VGAC.WS ask is $3.05
1/13/21, 10:15 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: So Buying the stock is good or the warrant? 

In case of VGAC STOCK IS AT 11.68 and VGAC/WS at 2.60 .

Warrant is also 100 shares as option?
1/13/21, 10:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Need to place limit order
1/13/21, 10:15 PM - +1 (904) 487-2057: Thanks Nash , but Warrants are not available in RH and Webull, which brokerage have warrants options?
1/13/21, 10:15 PM - +1 (917) 584-6536: 👍 ok
1/13/21, 10:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Td ameritrade fidelity
1/13/21, 10:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 1 warrant 1 share
1/13/21, 10:16 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Nash - For warrants if they are not able to find the target company I assume the warrants will be worthless
1/13/21, 10:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Generally
1/13/21, 10:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yes
1/13/21, 10:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: That's the biggest risk
1/13/21, 10:17 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: But with the stock itself you limited to $10 downside
1/13/21, 10:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep
1/13/21, 10:18 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Just wanted ppl to be aware of it while making decisions
1/13/21, 10:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: As I have explained, they cannot afford not finding a deal, its reputation risk. They know the target company before launching a spac
1/13/21, 10:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep, I explained in my write up above
1/13/21, 10:19 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Yes with reputable companies
1/13/21, 10:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yes we only need notable SPAC
1/13/21, 10:20 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: And with good track record
1/13/21, 10:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep, highlighted VGAX, because Branson had done virgin galactic, he is a billionaire and his own companies which are private and he can bring online.
1/13/21, 10:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: VGAC
1/13/21, 10:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Bring public
1/13/21, 10:24 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Cool, if that’s the case then why don’t we just invest a grand or two in this and wait, and if nothing happens we will get 75% of our investment right? As you mentioned that the risk is only of 25%, we can take that I guess , not sure if I am missing something.
1/13/21, 10:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: How do we know when this starts trading on or before Day 1?
1/13/21, 10:25 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I want to see the financial of the 2 rumors
1/13/21, 10:25 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If any
1/13/21, 10:25 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's volatile, so there is no hurry.
1/13/21, 10:26 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Understood.
1/13/21, 10:29 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Chamath Spacs always have premium from day 1
1/13/21, 10:29 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: We can buy it if we get a good price and offcourse sell it before the announcement if we don't like it.
1/13/21, 10:30 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep, ipoe went below $2 and is now 6.56
1/13/21, 10:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: IPOF went below $2 and now 4.6
1/13/21, 10:32 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: IPOG might be atleast couple of months out..he still has lot on his plate to finish.. they have to finalize ipod and ipof
1/13/21, 10:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep
1/13/21, 10:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: How do we get to know on day 1
1/13/21, 10:33 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Atleast for ipod, e ,f they all launched same day i think
1/13/21, 10:33 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Since it was Chamath lot of publicity around it
1/13/21, 10:33 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Google alert, Twitter account, cnbc
1/13/21, 10:34 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Td you have ipo calendar
1/13/21, 10:34 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: We shouldn't miss it, so just letting folks know here
1/13/21, 10:34 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ok, I don't use TD
1/13/21, 10:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Is it updated daily
1/13/21, 10:36 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: I have not checked months ahead
1/13/21, 10:37 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Here Warrant is trading at 2.6 and the stock at 11.68.
Does that mean that warrant allows me to buy this stock at 11.68+2.6 in future irrespective of the stock price at that time ?
1/13/21, 10:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The warrant allows you to buy the stock at 11.5
1/13/21, 10:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You already paid 2.68
1/13/21, 10:38 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Got it
1/13/21, 10:38 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Thanks !
1/13/21, 10:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So if the share price in the future is higher, you win
1/13/21, 10:38 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: So why Day 1 Nash
1/13/21, 10:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Because you need to set a limit order in or around $2
1/13/21, 10:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Need to get the warrant cheap
1/13/21, 10:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: As time passed, people know about the deal, warrant price increases in speculation
1/13/21, 10:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Passes
1/13/21, 10:41 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Yes warrants are at more premium.
1/13/21, 10:42 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: We need to get warrants below $3 to make it attractive
1/13/21, 10:42 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: If i see anything with IPOG..i will keep thr group posted
1/13/21, 10:42 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Thanks
1/13/21, 10:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Also for the group, lets find other attractive deals. We need a top notch sponsor who is interested in a hot sector and we need to find it early to make it work.
1/13/21, 10:44 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: OMG, 205 message in 2 hours 🤪🤪
1/13/21, 10:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Good night -)
1/13/21, 10:46 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Another question.. SBE/WS is trading at 19.10/- So if someone buy this warrant he can buy share at 11.50. So total cost is 19.10+11.50. Which is still less than SBE price of 42 ?
1/13/21, 10:46 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Am I missing something ?
1/13/21, 10:46 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: What is sbe share price
1/13/21, 10:46 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: 44.40 today
1/13/21, 10:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So you pay $30 with the warrant
1/13/21, 10:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And is at a discount to the current share price
1/13/21, 10:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Big arbitrage
1/13/21, 10:48 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Some of them have 2 warrants for 1 stock
1/13/21, 10:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Need to read the S1 for details
1/13/21, 10:48 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Right.. so even at current price you are around at around 40% profit
1/13/21, 10:48 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Ok
1/13/21, 10:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: As Arvind.mentioned it may be 2 warrants for 1 share
1/13/21, 10:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: All deals are unique, so need to read S1
1/13/21, 10:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Typically is 1 over 1
1/13/21, 10:50 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Got it !
1/13/21, 10:51 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: This is pretty interesting.. finding good SPAC is bit of a work though
1/13/21, 10:53 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: Also pays well if you hit the right one. 😊
1/13/21, 10:54 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Absolutely
1/13/21, 10:55 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: I missed KCAC ..Sold it before it turned to Quantumscape
1/13/21, 10:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Seems like market is expecting sbe price to come down on the day warrant gets exercised. They will coincide on the date of exercise.
1/13/21, 10:56 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: I was in at 13 and sold at 19..
1/13/21, 10:57 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Since then i stopped looking at QS
1/13/21, 10:58 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Yup.. I just took SBE as an example
1/13/21, 11:11 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: It’s a market and you will find customers for all products. So for ARK and BRK both. But I am with you if you are talking about a 60 year old person investing his retirement fund. Majority will be risk averse.
1/13/21, 11:23 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: It’s 15% up after market. So $3. So that I understand it correctly I will buy an option for $3. And if I want to exercise it then pay additional $10 (face value). So my cost of buying will be $13?
1/13/21, 11:24 PM - +1 (917) 584-6536: NGA.WS looks interesting.

On 11/30/2020 the company announced a pending merger with the Lion Electric Company , a leading manufacturer of all-electric medium and heavy-duty urban vehicles.
1/13/21, 11:36 PM - +1 (404) 904-7738: A quick note on a company that I have followed for a while. The company is ARCC. This is a BDC with market cap of about $7 Billion. They are trading in the range of $16 - 17. Wedbush today upgraded their price target to $18.25. ARCC pays a dividend of $0.40 every quarter. Nearly a 9 - 10% yield. They announce their earnings on Feb 10. BDCs have been hammered a lot, but in my opinion is a good recovery stock. And in any case I love my dividends. Please see if this stock works for your portfolio.

Nokia, Fuji film, Kodak, blackberry are classic examples, they forgot to innovate and the world forgot them irrespective of their legacy.
1/14/21, 12:10 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Warren did and he did out of the box, look at his apple investment timing. Anyways guys, this grp is not brk vs ark debate. Its all individual choices , i want all companies to do well and make all of us rich 😀
1/14/21, 12:11 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Warrants look interesting need to learn more on it.

1/14/21, 7:08 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Do you know what Aaple announced yesterday? Unable to find any..
1/14/21, 7:14 AM - +1 (201) 755-0082: Rumors going around abt Book+ as rival to kindle
1/14/21, 7:16 AM - +1 (201) 755-0082: Not a rumor. They announced books and audiobooks service
1/14/21, 7:17 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Oh ok
1/14/21, 7:22 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Big news was apple pledged $100M towards reducing racial inequality. They said big news is not about any product.

1/14/21, 7:46 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: $11.5+3. The share price needs to be more than 14.5 for you to make a profit after the merger announcement.
1/14/21, 7:48 AM - +1 (310) 748-7761: $CRSA (+5.7% pre) LiveVox to Go Public Through SPAC Deal with Crescent Acquisition (CRSA) -
1/14/21, 7:48 AM - +1 (310) 748-7761: Nash - any idea on livevox.. crsa at 10.99
1/14/21, 8:08 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: This is after the announcement. I was looking for opportunities pre annnouncent. I dont know much about livevox but looking at the price, doesn't seem that the market is excited. We need 50-100% pop when the merger is announced.
1/14/21, 8:15 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Nash- you are placing a Limit Order for VGAC warrant(VGAC/WS) today at $2?
1/14/21, 8:31 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's tough for it to reach $2, I will get it if it gets there and will decide if I plan to keep it after doing research on the rumors
1/14/21, 8:32 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Anyone going in today, let's play small, because you may have to exercise the share also at $11.50, if the merger is not great.
1/14/21, 8:33 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The lower the price the better <$2 is ideal ($1 for a new spac), $2-$2.5 is good execution, $2.5 and above is ok execution.
1/14/21, 8:35 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Also like stock, all warrants need not be bought on day 1, one can average it if it goes lower.
1/14/21, 8:41 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Ok .. let’s see what is the price once market opens
1/14/21, 8:55 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: <Media omitted>
1/14/21, 9:04 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep
1/14/21, 9:04 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The price will show
1/14/21, 9:06 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Around 2.79 premarket
1/14/21, 9:06 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Interesting concept. Thanks for sharing Nash.
1/14/21, 9:07 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍

1/14/21, 9:07 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Lot of new info to digest 😄, thanks to all contributors 👍🏻
1/14/21, 9:08 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: What is your limit?
1/14/21, 9:08 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Don't but market ever?
1/14/21, 9:09 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Yeah...I just bought some token orders. Was thinking of buying more after market opens. But it seems it will keep going up....So the question is whether to buy now in pre-market before it becomes too hyped or wait for market to open hoping to pull back?
1/14/21, 9:10 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It always pull back
1/14/21, 9:10 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's volatile
1/14/21, 9:10 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Patience and limit orders are your friens
1/14/21, 9:11 AM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Pre- market less liquidity
1/14/21, 9:11 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I had put limit 3.10 because you can’t buy market in pre-market (atleast for me in ETrade). I got it for 3.066.
1/14/21, 9:11 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: What limit price is good for this ?
1/14/21, 9:11 AM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Better to buy during market
1/14/21, 9:11 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Too high IMO. Try 2.50
1/14/21, 9:11 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Don't fomo out
1/14/21, 9:11 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Plenty of opportunities
1/14/21, 9:12 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Ya but the million $ question is with more liquidity whether it will go more up or down?
1/14/21, 9:12 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You don't need to buy today
1/14/21, 9:12 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: But when the shares are red
1/14/21, 9:12 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And the warrant is even more red
1/14/21, 9:13 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Because of leverage
1/14/21, 9:13 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The deal is not announced  and it can happen this week, it may take a month
1/14/21, 9:13 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Getting the best price is key IMO
1/14/21, 9:13 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Will wait for market to open. And see the trend.
1/14/21, 9:14 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Here is the reference of the deals I have seen. I personally will not pay over $3, its not worth it
1/14/21, 9:15 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: This warrant thing is too confusing to me. Why can't we just VGAC stock which is around $12.24 right now?
1/14/21, 9:15 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Because of leverage
1/14/21, 9:15 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's an option
1/14/21, 9:16 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: But buying a $2 warrant and then $11.5 makes you pp $13.5. Why not buy stock now for $12.5?
I might be missing something but don't understand what
1/14/21, 9:16 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So if share goes to 20, you make 63% return, the warrant will be 300%+
1/14/21, 9:17 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not buying the share, selling warrant when the deal is announced
1/14/21, 9:17 AM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Price realisation is better with more liquidity...but no guarantee...in this case there is no real news to drive price higher..
1/14/21, 9:17 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I got to go, see you at noon
1/14/21, 9:18 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: So basically it works as a call option.
1/14/21, 9:19 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep
1/14/21, 9:19 AM - +1 (404) 432-7444: There is no time value here
1/14/21, 9:20 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Good point.
1/14/21, 9:21 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's not expiring. You can exercise on day 30 and 12 mos. It remains valid till 5 yrs
1/14/21, 9:21 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Okay. I will read up some to understand this. Thank you.
1/14/21, 9:21 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So time is on your side
1/14/21, 9:22 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Unless the deal is so crappy, that it goes below $10
1/14/21, 9:22 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: In this case below $13.
1/14/21, 9:23 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: That’s our breakeven.
1/14/21, 9:24 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I thought leverage in case of option comes from the multiple, 1 option -100 stocks. But here if it is 1warrant-1stock, why the warrant price goes up disproportionate to the stock price?
1/14/21, 9:25 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I need to study a lot here 😂
1/14/21, 9:25 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Point hai.
1/14/21, 9:27 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Because it will move in sync with the stock price. Offcousre since you paid $2.5 and your option value is 8.5 when stock reaches 20, you make a higher percentage gain.
1/14/21, 9:28 AM - +1 (757) 285-8122: Price of warrant fluctuate in same proportion of underlying stock. Hence if stock goes up there is huge advantage but if stock goes down it's more loss than just holding stocks.
1/14/21, 9:30 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Up 20% since this message
1/14/21, 9:30 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: So the warrant movement is $ on $?
1/14/21, 9:31 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Buy VGAC at 11.5, stock price $20, gain 73%
Buy VCAC/w at $2.5, stock price $20, gain ($8.5/2.5-1) 240%
1/14/21, 9:31 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It will be close
1/14/21, 9:32 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Here is an illustration
1/14/21, 9:32 AM - +1 (404) 432-7444: GIK  up nice today
1/14/21, 9:34 AM - +1 (732) 857-9973: Affirm 15% up
1/14/21, 9:34 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ravi will kill me
1/14/21, 9:36 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Don’t worry bro. Same money put in VGAC 🙂
1/14/21, 9:38 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Got it. Thanks.
1/14/21, 9:51 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: BNGO going good today
1/14/21, 9:53 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Exercising the share is optional or mandatory?
1/14/21, 10:00 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: it is crazy today
1/14/21, 10:02 AM - +1 (412) 915-0706: SNOW

1/14/21, 10:16 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: But you will lose warrant value if you don’t exercise. That’s the maximum downside.
1/14/21, 10:20 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: DNMR rocking. Thanks again Nash 🙏🏼

1/14/21, 10:26 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Warrant strategy is a new one for me and out of my wheelhouse, so am hoping to master it. May take time and there may be a fumble or two. I would urge everyone to play small, and increase as we get smarter.

1/14/21, 2:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Blue Prism delivered solid results today growing 46% despite covid impact. The CEO was obviously frustrated because the shareholders responded by punishing shares down by 15%. They are thinking of shifting the listing to Wall Street, which may result in significant multiple expansion. 

While it is down 15% today, it's up 55% from our discussion on August of last year.

Please look into HAACU SPAC, it is lead by Livongo Mgmt-Glen Tullman, Jennifer Schneider etc and they have 500Mn+ ready to deploy.
1/14/21, 10:48 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: My watchlist for tomorrow:
RMO- Romeo Power( $RMO) is a nice EV battery play IMO. As a stock, it reached an all time high close to $40 and currently sits under $23. Look into it and decide if you like it.
IBIO- Should go up on some hype for pr.
SNDL- Weed sector will be hyped before the week of Biden’s inauguration 
SENS-**Soros Fund Management** holds 10m shares, **PHC** holds a staggering 24% stake, **Roche Holding** is a multibillion dollar Swiss company in the pharmaceutical/diagnostics space!
UAVS- Market will most likely be generally up so I expect this to have a pop. Most likely will be a day trade in my opinion.
1/14/21, 10:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yes I was following this. The warrant spiked up today, but this is on my radar.
1/14/21, 10:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Thanks for bringing it up

1/14/21, 11:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Love the management
1/14/21, 11:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If I cannot get the warrant, I will get the shares
1/14/21, 11:01 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: have a question .. 

I bought a Put for $18 Strike Price for 29-Jan, Paid premium of .75 .. so my break even is 17.25 … Now the stock Price is 16.10 , Hence the premium should be 18-16.10=1.9 (intrinsic value ) at the minimum + some extrinsic , correct? the premium I see is .47 .. Which is not making sense to me ..

Per my calculation  premium should be 1.9 … i paid .75 .. I should be in profit .. but somehow it shows in loss .. it shows .47 
Any thoughts?
1/14/21, 11:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Pretty confident on Taneja and Tullman
1/14/21, 11:01 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yepp.. sad they left post Teladoc acquisition.
1/14/21, 11:02 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: I see something as below in my account statement today for the same contract

1/14/21, 11:03 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Nash or anybody .. do you know what this is? And is it the reason for wrong premium calculation?
1/14/21, 11:06 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Not much expert in options but i think you are not considering time value.
1/14/21, 11:09 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: I’m considering it .. 
my knowledge says premium = intrinsic +extrinsic 

Where intrinsic = stock price - strike price ( for buy)

Extrinsic = holds theta and vega etc.. 

So i’m saying my intrinsic is 1.9 and the premium should atleast be intrinsic even if 0 extrinsic .. isn’t it correct?
1/14/21, 11:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Your put is in the money, not sure why it shows 0.47
1/14/21, 11:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Call the broker

1/15/21, 11:05 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Do you think it’s bottomed out? There is a negative news that is making it crash.

SHW (Sherwin Williams). Yes it’s the paint company. Super strong financials. Nice products. And home building is going to be the talk of the town (because of the sky high home prices) for the next 5-10 years. And painting is the easy home improvement anyone can do.

1/15/21, 1:51 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Added more Fcel today, some analyst gave a price target of 10 for the stock and its going through a tough time, but I think it will be of 30 at least in next few quarters if not months.
1/15/21, 1:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Coming soon
1/15/21, 1:51 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Knew it 👍

1/15/21, 1:53 PM - +1 (419) 215-2329: FCEL is $16.25 now. Price target $30 or typo  10?
1/15/21, 1:53 PM - +1 (419) 215-2329: Pl. Share more details
1/15/21, 1:54 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Analyst downgraded it to 10, but I have a high conviction on this hence loaded today at 15.5
1/15/21, 1:55 PM - +1 (419) 215-2329: Understand.  Thanks. I am with you 👍

1/15/21, 2:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There is a short report on the company
1/15/21, 2:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I would be apprehensive on adding more. We will need to wait of analyst and management come out and defend
1/15/21, 2:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If they don't, I will likely exit.
1/15/21, 2:54 PM - +1 (502) 296-0435: Ok 🙏

1/15/21, 3:06 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: As they have bypassed the pre engagement rules of SPAC, what is the worst outcome of it if it comes out to be right ?
1/15/21, 3:08 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It seems they hit the bottom as the graph is reversing
1/15/21, 3:09 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I dont know the outcome. I typically stay away from companies that are Frauds. If management could not be relied upon on past numbers, how can be trusted on what they are seeing in the future. I have seen Spacs lose 80% of their value.
1/15/21, 3:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The report suggest that the SPAC company had previous relationship with the ceo, so its tricky to figure out the real value of the company.
1/15/21, 3:11 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Got it, will let it go!
1/15/21, 3:12 PM - +1 (502) 296-0435: Thanks Nash. Came out of it on small loss
1/15/21, 3:12 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: They plugged in an "the office" video to explain. Lol
1/15/21, 3:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It sucks. If the CEO comes out and defend, the shares may bounce to 11-11.5, at which point I will exit
1/15/21, 3:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Still will lose on this trade 😔
1/15/21, 3:19 PM - +1 (502) 296-0435: Good luck 👍🏻
1/15/21, 3:22 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Hi All, 
anyone entered in space exploration companies today? SPCE looks lucrative at today’s price but I like MAXR though, please share your views I want to make a position today in either of the two.
1/15/21, 3:22 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: I exited with some loss
1/15/21, 3:23 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Will enter later again if things look good

1/15/21, 4:28 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I guess the damage is already done. The word is already in the market.

1/18/21, 4:43 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: Mutual fund investment in India being in US is not allowed afaik.
1/18/21, 4:43 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: However thru NRE/O account it might be possible but never checks
1/18/21, 4:44 PM - +1 (425) 786-5518: Checked
1/18/21, 4:45 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: though u can always invest from ur parents account ;)
1/18/21, 5:37 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: You can. But it’s taxed as an index fund in USA. A bit Complicated but you can do it.
1/18/21, 5:38 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: How much average return you get from Indian MF's?
1/18/21, 5:38 PM - +1 (614) 929-0516: So if investing in MF jointly with parents ... that should be ok?
1/18/21, 5:40 PM - +1 (614) 929-0516: Opening MF via NRE account without any indian counterpart?
1/18/21, 5:48 PM - +1 (205) 535-5323: CCIV is a good buy in short term? Seems like it is having a deal with Lucid (Luxury EV vehicle’s company)
1/18/21, 6:27 PM - +1 (205) 535-5323: NIO also I am looking to enter into, seems like it is the most actively traded stock according to finviz and also trending a lot on YouTube
1/18/21, 7:58 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Depends on MF. And no one has crystal ball.
1/18/21, 7:59 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I don’t think you can have a Jt account with your resident parent. You can either have a resident account or an NRI account.
1/18/21, 8:00 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: You have to open an NRI trading account in india. You don’t need anyone from india. You can open in your name.
1/18/21, 8:00 PM - +1 (614) 929-0516: You mean NRO or NRE account?
1/18/21, 8:02 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: The account is called Non resident trading account and most of the indian banks offer this service.
1/18/21, 8:02 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: You will have to open an NRO savings account and a demat account and link all three together. You just call any bank and they will do all for you.
1/18/21, 8:05 PM - +1 (614) 929-0516: So once I open this account, investing in MF jointly or someone from India won’t be mandatory right? I can do it all by myself alone ?
1/18/21, 8:07 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Yes not asking for any predictions. But in general I believe Indian MF's would do better than US MF's
1/18/21, 8:08 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I will not agree with this generalized statement :).
1/18/21, 8:09 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Well I'm not sure. That's why asking!
1/18/21, 8:09 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: NRE & NRO both account should be opened up. After that, an additional account is opened for trading/demat/MF investments.
1/18/21, 8:11 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Money would go from NRE to NRO and then to the demat account. 

Bringing money back from NRO to NRE is not straightforward. A CA certification will be required and he/she will attest the bank that the funds were tfd from NRE to NRO. 

NRE money can be repatriated back. NRO cannot.
1/18/21, 8:11 PM - +1 (614) 929-0516: Ravi and Sachin.. thanks for it his info . One last thing .. the non resident trading account u mentioned above will be subject to taxation in India or US ? Do I need to declare it while filing my US or India return?
1/18/21, 8:11 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: In addition, the short term capital gain will attract TDS for an NRI. The tax filing has to be done in India and same has to be used in US filing as there is double treaty
1/18/21, 8:13 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: LT capital gain has lower tax just like here. You can reinvest LT gain

Also, best is to have Growth MF that won’t pay you dividend and the money will grow. When you withdraw after a year, it won’t be taxable in India but will be taxable in US
1/18/21, 8:14 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Hope I have complicated it enough for you to not invest in India 😃😃
1/18/21, 8:15 PM - +1 (614) 929-0516: 😳 this looks way too complex .  So to be sure that I am following right thing, who will be best person to assist? The Indian bank account customer service or an Indian Tax agent?
1/18/21, 8:17 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: All the info is available in google. 

I can connect you to an Indian CA friend as well.
1/18/21, 8:17 PM - +1 (551) 580-3181: Yes, any global income to be reported in Resident country, if NRO then process is different
1/18/21, 8:18 PM - +1 (551) 580-3181: for less complexity better to open NRE so you can file all taxes in USA
1/18/21, 8:26 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: All good advice. I will add one more point. You can transfer money in NRO account from any Indian resident account as well. Be it your own or by someone else.
1/18/21, 8:29 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: MF taxation in USA is different. You better take advice from your financial advisor. It’s not like you pay tax when you sell. For that reason I have stopped investing further in Indian MF.
1/18/21, 8:31 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I believe NRE and NRO have to be reported in a similar way. Plz elaborate if you know the difference.

1/18/21, 8:46 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👆👆👆Nicely summarized. Can we pick top 10? Or may be too 20 worth investing🙂
1/18/21, 8:54 PM - +1 (732) 956-6246: Hi all, I didn't find any option to trade US options from India.. We have Vested international platform for trading stocks and ETFs, and the same with banks like HDFC and ICICI... please let me know if you come across any option. Thanks.
1/18/21, 8:59 PM - +60 19-221 9450: Try interactive brokers, this is good link to compare

1/18/21, 9:00 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: This is great summary, not sure of top 10/20 or not but I will put where I am invested, so far getting good returns-
EV- TSLA, NIO, XPEV, Li
EV SPAC- ACTC(it’s not in the list though), CIIV(planning to enter on a pull back, again it’s not here in the list)

1/18/21, 9:51 PM - +1 (732) 956-6246: Even all these trading platforms are for stocks and ETFs, not for options
1/18/21, 10:05 PM - +1 (551) 580-3181: NRO gained interest will be TDS at 30% and you need to file ITR in india to get refund then 
In USA apply  
Foreign tax credit form 1116 wile doing tax return.
in case of NRE there is no TDS, all they taxes are filed in USA in ordinary income tax bracket. But there are differences if you have any section 80c exemptions in india then NRO may be benefeciary , there is always a extra step of filing ITR and Form 1116 in USA
1/18/21, 10:06 PM - +1 (551) 580-3181: 👍
1/18/21, 10:11 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: So where is the Covid package going? Most of the > $200 wine bottles are now out of stock. Those who could never afford $10-15 bottles are now buying 

Wine shops are making huge business and will continue to do it for next 12-24 months until the free money keeps pouring

Food for thought, which stock to buy :)

1/19/21, 12:00 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I was just looking at it. 👍🏻
1/19/21, 12:03 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Superb Analysis Anand P, you have a long way to go 👍
1/19/21, 12:03 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: And based on the current investors holding I am planning to play this long term. Like DKNG.
1/19/21, 12:04 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: DKNG is down today, is it a good entry point?
1/19/21, 12:07 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: You may. I have seen this a range bound 48-55 for the past month. So may go down a little more. But if I am you and have no holding then will start today and will add more in further pull down/rally. I already own quite a bit so will wait more. And if goes down around 47-48 then I am buying options.
1/19/21, 12:07 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Got it, thanks
1/19/21, 12:45 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: This statement is coming in hindsight. It could have easily gone the other way.

I follow a set of principles that I abide by which essentially helps me run my portfolio like a business. Its little philosophical, but I wouldn't do anything that doesn't deliver better risk adjusted return in my eyes. Buying at $3 is high where I can buy equal or better opportunities elsewhere, and there are lots of them IMO. 
 
Offcourse I will miss a few, but in total, if I purchase anything, I am generally very confident on my purchase price and the chance to make money out if it.

1/19/21, 1:06 PM - +1 (347) 439-8391: I did open small with average cost of 2.97. Hopefully it goes up from here onwards.
1/19/21, 1:08 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I hope so it works for everyone who bought
1/19/21, 1:20 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: VGAC ws is at 3.45 will it still be a good price to enter?
1/19/21, 1:39 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thanks Nash. However I see your point though. Even with today’s rally the warrant is still not above the today’s cost. I mean 11.50 FV+ 3 (my price) = 14.50 vs today stock price 13.77. Do you know if I can keep the warrant long enough or I have to exercise within 30 days or so?
1/19/21, 1:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: My strategy is to sell half at 50-100% profit and the remaining on the day of announcement
1/19/21, 1:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You may need to reach $6 to make 100%
1/19/21, 1:42 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Which may be tough but not impossible before the deal announcement
1/19/21, 1:42 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: @12015655130  are we still keeping GDRX or there is a change in view?
1/19/21, 1:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Added a new warrant today at $2. Herein below are the details.

Name: Cohn Robbins Holdings Corp.

Focus area: Technology, software or Fintech companies

Deal Sponsors: 
Gary Cohn: President Trump's Chief economic advisor. Before serving in white house, he was the president and COO of Goldman Sachs

Cliff Robbins: CEO of Blue Harbor group. Prior to that he was the General Partner at KKR, a prominent PE firm. Some of his notable investments are Xilinx, Jack in the Box, Webmd, Caci, Webmd, all of which have been multibaggers since IPO. 

All other management and board of directors have significant experience in PE firms and have senior level position in top companies.

Happy to buy more at every 5-10% fall from here.
1/19/21, 1:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am holding it. Want to hold it until I hear the quarterly results

1/19/21, 2:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah its a volatile instrument, and trading around is tough. Hopefully if we hear some rumors in the next month or so, it will be good enough to get atleast the principal back.

1/19/21, 3:13 PM - +1 (732) 983-7189: Do we need to buy 100 share for 1 warrant ?
1/19/21, 3:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 1 share 1 warrant
1/19/21, 3:14 PM - +1 (732) 983-7189: So how much we should buy ?
1/19/21, 3:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Don't know, depend on how much risk you want to take
1/19/21, 3:16 PM - +1 (732) 983-7189: I mean in general what is your strategy ? Once it’s high do we need to buy 100 share for each warrant ?
1/19/21, 3:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 1 warrant is 1 share
1/19/21, 3:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So if you buy today at $2
1/19/21, 3:16 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And later have to exercise a share at 11.5
1/19/21, 3:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Your total outlay is 100x13.5= 1350
1/19/21, 3:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: For 100 warrants
1/19/21, 3:17 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I have placed some for 1.90. Let’s see if this comes.
1/19/21, 3:18 PM - +1 (732) 983-7189: Got it , thanks.

1/19/21, 8:07 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: yeap, i hold that too at similar price
1/19/21, 8:11 PM - +60 19-221 9450: I am looking to buy more of it on some dip, lets see when we get the buying opportunity
1/19/21, 8:11 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: What is better app to use? Robinhood or Webull? I have started using Webull but thought to check
1/19/21, 8:12 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Won't go more than .45. this could be a good selling point and wait for one more dip to invest again at .25-.27
1/19/21, 8:13 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: RH is better than Webull
1/19/21, 8:16 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: 👍

1/19/21, 8:41 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Any prediction for Exela tomorrow?
1/19/21, 8:42 PM - +1 (973) 405-0388: Webull gives you trading from 4:00am to 8:00pm. That’s a big advantage for limit sells in stocks having explosive pre and after market moves ( most of the penny stocks )
1/19/21, 8:42 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Can it make to 1.50 tomorrow?
1/19/21, 8:42 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Yes, this is better than Webull in this case.

$NBY - Mask play with 4 hour chart looking extremely bullish here. Should run after Biden gets inaugurated. Price target $4.70 as the mask mandate becomes more mainstream news.

$SRNE - AH NEWS Sorrento to Present Data Demonstrating STI-2020 Preserves Binding Against UK B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 Mutated Spike Protein. Resistance at $10.36 and if this become support then we can see a PT of $11.27

$AHPI - with the spread of Covid again and the recent oxygen shortage in many areas around the globe, this stock could easily break the EMA200 AT 6.52 and run to next major resistance at $9.70 Keep in mind, this company only has 2.8M public shares float and institutions own more than 9.5% AHPI will move quickly.

TECHNICALS:

$OPTT – Golden Crosson as of 1/19/21

$CIDM - Cup and handle on the daily with a measured move to $2. Stock was up 40% today. Looking for major continuation moving forward here. Today Cinedigm announced that it has acquired Fandor, a subscription streaming service, with plans to relaunch indie film service which closed its doors in 2018. Cinedigm believes they could top 1 million subscribers within 24-30 months. The fandor acquisition solidifies Cinedigm's postion as THE leading global streaming company for independent films. Referenced as "the Netflix of Indie."

$EQ - Initial product candidate, itolizumab, is a first-in-class immune-modifying monoclonal antibody that targets the CD6-ALCAM signaling pathway. The CD6-ALCAM signaling pathway plays a central role in the modulation of effector T cells (Teff cells). Activated Teff cells drive a number of immuno-inflammatory diseases across therapeutic areas including transplant science, systemic autoimmunity, pulmonary, neurologic, gastrointestinal, renal, vascular, ophthalmic and dermatologic disorders. Therefore, we believe itolizumab may have broad therapeutic utility in treating a large and diverse set of severe immuno-inflammatory diseases. 2 hour chart ultimate moving average just crossed over the golden cross indicator and printed a "long." This most likely has a PR coming soon about its prime candidate. Price Target: $8.98

$TBLT - OFFERING announced today. Look for a short term pull back to $0.90-95 (old resistance). Weekly buy arrow just printed on the supertrend. Resistance since June 2020 was just broken last week. The daily ultimate moving average just crossed over the golden cross indicator today, implying to me that this recent move is just the beginning for TBLT. Great swing opportunity here after the offering is complete that was announced today and it pulls back to test new support level. The company is now roughly 2 years away from profitability. Market will anticipate the future new earnings.

$BORR on a healthy pull back. Support seems to have been found around .88-.89. If my calculations are correct. With current ROC we should see a nice run incoming from imminent MA golden cross on the daily chart. There are indications that this move can fail. Def worth watching. I have PT 1.40-1.80-2.40

$KODK - MACD and RSI for any potential breakouts. Watching $8.90 area for a range break. Bullish trend

$AAPL - “Apple’s stock is not detached from a realistic outlook on the future of the business (excluding an Apple Car). If anything, the stock may continue to be a bargain.

While Apple’s stock trades at a premium relative to its five-year average price-to-earnings multiple, at 32 times estimated earnings the stock trades well below comparable multiples for Amazon (58 times) and Netflix (57 times). And of course, Apple shares trade below the 204 times forward price-to-earnings multiple on electric vehicle favorite Tesla (TSLA).” PT: $150 by the end of March.

1/20/21, 8:44 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Selling and buying again, involves a lot of energy and monitoring, so I typically keep it as is and let compounding do its magic in normal markets

1/20/21, 11:04 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: i bought at dips today.. mara

1/20/21, 11:23 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: usually in downward pressure it tries to close gap below and bounces

If Btc price holds above 33500, its good time to enter

i will let @12015655130 and other confirm the same
1/20/21, 11:23 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: by the way, i did put buy order at 17.70 and got it

1/21/21, 8:38 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Anything can happen with the stock, if they prove that the report is wrong and show good results. I will exit though
1/21/21, 8:57 AM - +1 (973) 405-0388: I wonder if the $50million buyback will lead to a short squeeze ? Not sure when the buyback is happening
1/21/21, 8:58 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah, saying they will buyback and actually buying back is different. I have trust issues now
1/21/21, 9:02 AM - +1 (551) 580-3181: is this time to exit from MARA?
1/21/21, 9:03 AM - +1 (502) 296-0435: Not sure but average it out. I’m in same boat too MARA dala 😂😂
1/21/21, 9:07 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: Until BTC finds bottom, mara will be volatile 

i strongly believe BTC is not yet done, so i am holding and buying at more dips
1/21/21, 9:08 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: though i initially bought at very bottom
1/21/21, 9:09 AM - +1 (732) 208-1574: I am also believing same here

1/21/21, 10:00 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You are talking about market timing. Remember if you would have sold MELI or Shopify? Typically will only sell at market tops or if the story changes.

I am expecting we see trend reversal from there. Compared to IIPR they are valued cheap as of now. If cannabis story is intact they will be benefitting a lot. This can be potential multi bagger

1/21/21, 11:55 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: I think it's a hold for MRNA, the company is adding staff for reaching 1.2 billion doses by 2022, this is key because covid 19 is here to stay.it posted 24 pc gain in first 2 weeks of this year (if am not wrong)

With Bitcoin, one can only hope that someone will buy it at a higher price
It doesn't have any earnings to back it
1/21/21, 12:25 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: reminds me of greater fool theory 😀

Gold has limited utility, but still commands of 8tn market cap

Bitcoin is governed by the power of the network with an ability to create an immutable record on the blockchain, which can be argued as 1000 times better than currencies used by Government, which btw is also created out of thin air.
1/21/21, 12:30 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: 👌 👍 👍
1/21/21, 12:34 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: This network value can have a number of use cases like recording title records of real estate on the blockchain, supply chain information of where your food is coming from, voting record of who actually voted in the election. 

Its a smart form of money which also is viewed as digital gold by some. Its only a matter of time that world will understand its true value.

When that happens, the train may have left the station and all money that is there to be made have been made.

1/21/21, 12:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Taking example of Ethereum, it generated $180Mm in fees in the first 17 days of Jan, translating in $4bn of annualized number. Can't be a $0 value or greater fool theory for a network that generates so much in fees and is just getting started.
1/21/21, 12:55 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: you are right, I do have investment into the cypto from when btc was and 5k. Long term I do believe the supply demand will keep pushing the price higher due to the limited supply.
1/21/21, 12:57 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: dont know much about the technicalities, but if BTC and ETH rallied in the past, crashed and then has capability of rallying again which we have seen. any crash is the buying opportunity mostly what we do with stocks. ppl who bought BTC in cents and again bought when it went to 3k$ would be feeling the same :)

1/21/21, 12:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah given this is not accepted yet, it goes through peak and bust cycles for long periods of time, so timing is everything in this game.
1/21/21, 1:07 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Low volume and low float  are concerns

1/21/21, 2:02 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I remember you said that before. I have that position as well. A full position (as per my standard though that may change). So what is a better policy? Keep in both or sell Fastly and add same money to NET?
1/21/21, 2:05 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: As a matter of fact I have earned as much in Fastly with half position as in NET with full position. Again I entered FSTLY during previous dip at a very bright time with $89. And did not wait for dip in NET. Just wanted to make my position.
1/21/21, 2:10 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Bright = right. Typo.

1/21/21, 2:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Both companies should benefit. Fastly is geared towards more larger customers, and cloudfare towards small to middle market. Fastly is cheaper but Cloudfare is higher quality. I would keep in both albeit smaller in Fastly given its higher volatility.
1/21/21, 2:38 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Got it. You are right about volatility and so I was tempted to book profit at 105 and wait for another dip. But then researched and saw the news of upgrade. So will keep it for now. We will see around 120s. NET is more firm.
1/21/21, 2:40 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I know there is lot of excitement for their medical imaging technology which is ground breaking and have a huge market, however the company does not generate any revenue yet. Analyst expect revenue to be $20mm next year, which will still be 180x sales. It's obscenely overvalued for my taste, so I am avoiding until I see real sales.
1/21/21, 2:47 PM - +1 (412) 915-0706: Thanks @12015655130, very helpful.
1/21/21, 2:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If you had entered Apple at $200bn, you could still have made a 10x. Not saying this is apple, but you will not be late even if you buy this at $7bn valuation vs 3.5bn today minus the risk - Only if they prove that their working product is significantly better than anything in the market.
1/21/21, 3:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: All else is speculation, which may still be OK in moderation
1/21/21, 3:01 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Buying apple at $200bn :(

1/21/21, 6:09 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Deliberate fake news
1/21/21, 6:10 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Bitcoin transactions should not be considered settled 100% till about 6 confirmation.

1/21/21, 6:12 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Consensus fork in Bitcoin happens every 2 weeks on an average, this was deliberate misinformation spread to shake off the weak hands
1/21/21, 6:12 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I will consider anything less than $30k good buying price
1/21/21, 6:13 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I think we could dip as much as $25k, but 50% chance of that.
1/21/21, 6:13 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: $20k will be 15% probability. I will sell my car and house to buy bitcoin under $20k.
1/21/21, 6:25 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Panic selling so big tycoons can pitch in... We have seen this from $6500 to $41000. Big companies investing. It's not hype. Even if it is, reality is it will be the most precious coin.
1/21/21, 7:33 PM - +1 (205) 535-5323: Below 30 k now

1/21/21, 8:09 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Someone has to pay for the free money being distributed to people who do not need it. Sooner or later the bill will arrive
1/21/21, 8:10 PM - +1 (860) 333-2568: Within four years it's bound to happen with some hike on the corner
1/21/21, 8:11 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Until Dems have majority in house and senate
1/21/21, 8:12 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: I dont think government can pay for these expenses with insane tax hike, that will be suicide.
1/21/21, 8:12 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: It will be more printing, and printing will accelerate, $ will keep debasing.
1/21/21, 8:12 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Fed likes inflation
1/21/21, 8:12 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Inflation will address part of it, as value of money will reduce
1/21/21, 8:13 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: yes, so my 2 cents,, buy hard scarce assets
1/21/21, 8:13 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Or buy international assets
1/21/21, 8:13 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: buy good real estate; buy BTC, buy some Gold, buy good stocks (although stocks have already inflated).
1/21/21, 8:15 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: well,, all central banks around the world work in tandem to print. so when Joe chacha prints, modi kaka can also print, maintaining $ peg at 73-78 range.
1/21/21, 8:15 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Point is dont keep your wealth in government printed shitcoins like USD, Euro, INR etc.
1/21/21, 8:15 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: keep your real wealth in hard scarce asset.
1/21/21, 8:15 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: And always go short on shitcoins.
1/21/21, 8:16 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Take more debt, if you can find good investment opportunity.
1/21/21, 8:16 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Inflation rewards the debtors, and punishes savers.
1/21/21, 8:16 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Modi sahab and before that singh saheb have already printed so much that currency has lost 50% value in past 10-15 years. Look beyond and check other emerging markets which has low inflation rate
1/21/21, 8:17 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: Dont save, take debt, use it to buy hard assets -> way to wealth
1/21/21, 8:17 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Savings is giving free money to government :)
1/21/21, 8:18 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: bhai, every indian government has printed. India has very competitive politics with lots of pressure groups always fighting for bigger share of the pie
1/21/21, 8:18 PM - +1 (516) 606-8934: yes, its like paying more tax

1/22/21, 4:46 AM - +1 (917) 584-6536: Food for thought - Although Information Technology has room for growth and innovation, I think the next frontier is Robotics.  We already seeing special-purpose robots- like robots which vacuum the house, robots which mows the lawn, robotic cars which take people from point a to b, monorails, special purpose industrial robots, war robots, bomb diffusing robots etc. The market will gradually move from special purpose to general-purpose robots. This space has huge potential to innovate. Next 3-5 years we should see tremendous growth in this space.

Monitoring this space would help us find opportunities to invest at the right time.

1/22/21, 4:25 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Extended though, so will not be surprised if there is a pullback
1/22/21, 4:25 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Dnmr what a swing
1/22/21, 4:26 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Entered at 24
1/22/21, 4:26 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Looks it will double in few weeks

1/22/21, 4:26 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍
1/22/21, 4:27 PM - Niteen: Still a good time to enter or wait for the pull back?
1/22/21, 4:27 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah, seems extended to me
1/22/21, 4:28 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It was discussed at $14
1/22/21, 4:31 PM - Niteen: Yeah..missed the boat for this one..👍 I'll wait for the pull back.
1/22/21, 4:59 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I so missed this 3x in 3 months opportunity. By maybe 20 cents when it was around 15-16. 
Sometimes its wise to increase your limit order rather than missing by few cents. Lesson learnt!
1/22/21, 5:03 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: And now it has doubled its price since 3pm today. For no apparent reason.
1/22/21, 5:04 PM - +1 (856) 408-8842: <Media omitted>
1/22/21, 5:04 PM - +1 (856) 408-8842: This is probably the reason why express went up
1/22/21, 5:15 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Thank you.
1/22/21, 5:16 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: But that's ridiculous. Express has nothing going for it to be at $10. But then sense always doesn't prevail.
1/22/21, 5:37 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👍🏻. I am from the same school of thought.
1/22/21, 5:38 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Don’t miss by few cents.
1/22/21, 5:43 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Today has been so frustrating. I bought Express at $1.04 7 months back and held it all along even when it went down to 58 cents. And finally I sold it at $1.21 around 3pm today with small gain. 
Then 1 analyst compares it to another company risking bankruptcy (gamestop) and says $10 target price. No strong reason how we derived that price other than comparing to gamestop. And now the price is almost triple of my pp. $2.80 right now in after market. I know I made a small profit and should not be greedy. But this is hair ripping stuff. 
Just wanted to share/vent.
1/22/21, 5:45 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: reminds me of selling nvax at 9$ that too huge position 

Nvax went to above 200$

learnt to live with it eventually

1/22/21, 6:22 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I know I'm not the only one and also not the first time it happened with me. 
But this one if say I had not checked markets at 3pm and instead checked after 4pm my portfolio would be few thousands more.

1/23/21, 12:08 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Hear the calls and analyze
1/23/21, 12:08 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Investor call heeding is very important. Or read the text and their submissions to SEC

1/23/21, 12:12 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Analysts judge the company based on that. They write articles and the big investors decide on their future game plan. 

So if we have sticks fit long term we should hear these calls or recording later.

RB doesn’t have looks like
1/25/21, 9:54 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: RH doesnt do warrants. Schwab does warrants. Probably also TD, etrade
1/25/21, 9:54 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Warrants have an upper limit, the cheaper you get, that increases your potential return. Though $2.4 is still not bad vs everything else in the market.

 Its still speculative as you know since they have not identified a company.

1/25/21, 10:22 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Any example ?
1/25/21, 10:36 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Most shares have $18 limit, if they trade for 20 days out of 30, the company can force a cashless conversion. For eg

Share price: $18
Strike price: $11.5
At money warrant: $6.5 (the warrant  price can be lower than that)

So the company can force you to buy shares at $11.5, and you can sell in the open market at $18.
1/25/21, 10:37 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It may depend from company to company if they want to exercise this right
1/25/21, 10:39 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Oh ok .. thank you Nash
1/25/21, 10:40 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The objective of our warrant trading strategy is to dispose a portion of shares at 50-100% profit and the remaining on the day of merger

1/25/21, 12:34 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Expected to reveal $100B Q4 profits tomorrow. And bumper sales of iPhone 12, news of new  macbook air. Maybe the EV as well.
1/25/21, 12:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Added FMAC/W today at $2.33. 

First mark is a early stage venture capital company and based out of NY. They have a portfolio of 100+ companies that they can bring to the market. Some of their early stage notable investments were  Shopify, Pinterest, Draftking, Ab&b, riot games and unwork among others. The team is led by Rick Heitzmann, who has been named as one of the world's top venture capitalist by Forbes in 2020. He is also the board of directors of NY venture capital association. I consider their team top notch with folks from Bloomberg Ventures, Merrill Lynch, Etsy, McKinsey, Draftking etc. If they cannot execute , not sure who can. 

Happy to buy more warrants if the price goes lower from here. 

FYI - They have bought warrants at $1.5 price, so I will load the boat, if it ever trades between 1.5-2.0
1/25/21, 12:41 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If market goes down, we should take it as a buying opportunity. We are early to mid stage of a bull market.
1/25/21, 12:42 PM - +1 (201) 850-0875: <Media omitted>
1/25/21, 12:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's a warrant
1/25/21, 12:43 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: the upside in GME is due to a short squeeze, it is basically an outdated business model. Those of you who remember the Blockbuster, GME is another blockbuster and very likely will meet the same fate.
1/25/21, 12:43 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: These are high risk..most of the times retail investors lose money than profit

1/25/21, 12:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's a short term trade, so I doubt, but don't have much insight
1/25/21, 12:49 PM - +1 (847) 848-2392: Oh ok thanks 👍
1/25/21, 1:07 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: It’s already 2.47... is it still a good buy?
1/25/21, 1:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: My limit order was filled. I will not be able to suggest if there will be a pullback in the short run or will go higher. Folks can use their judgment.

1/25/21, 1:21 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: As long as your broker allows, you can buy Bala. Just beware of fees and commissions.
1/25/21, 1:29 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I bought a different warrant in my ROTH.
1/25/21, 1:29 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: That would be at the purchase right? Not at the time of sale.
1/25/21, 1:30 PM - +1 (847) 848-2392: Thanks Vijay and kunal 👍.. I will check
1/25/21, 1:42 PM - +1 (214) 864-9317: Guys any recommendations on Apple investment, long term and safe??
1/25/21, 1:48 PM - +1 (214) 864-9317: Should I wait before they declare their earnings next week or its not worth buying
1/25/21, 1:53 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Is there any app which captures transaction history(stock and option) from all your brokerage account and helps in tracking your portfolio and also create IRS reportable version ?
1/25/21, 2:01 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Some brokers might charge for trading (buying and/or selling) warrants because these are kind of derived products.
1/25/21, 2:04 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I didnt pay anything to buy. I'm trying to find if they would charge to sell. I guess I'll find out when I do sell.
1/25/21, 2:19 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Last week the management came forward for a share purchase program, give it some time it should at least jump a bit, I did enter at 7.5 on Friday for a quick gain, there have been analysts who has came back with price targets ranging from 16 to 23, if you are stuck high don’t sell it on loss.
1/25/21, 2:20 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thanks buddy. Bought between 11-12. I am willing to wait.
1/25/21, 2:31 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Post share offerings companies like SENS, TRXC, BNGO etc have become quite stable and are good to go for next few years, they have good products and it’s just matter of time that they start generating revenue for them, they might registers good earnings in next few quarters. 
Investing couple of grands and waiting for few quarters might provide good returns. BNGO has gained exponentially but Sens and trxc seems to be still in buying range, I might be wrong though, it’s just my perspective
1/25/21, 2:33 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash, just entered at 2.4
1/25/21, 2:34 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: SENS .. i entered a couple days back .. and booked profit today .. came out and planning to enter again..

1/25/21, 2:38 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: You prefer stocks, right ?
1/25/21, 2:38 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Same here. It sucks to have losses, particularly if  company is trying to defraud you. Part and parcel of the process though.
1/25/21, 2:38 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Don’t have much choice as don’t understand them much 😁
1/25/21, 2:41 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: I think you understand this business pretty well
1/25/21, 2:43 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍
1/25/21, 2:44 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Just been lucky so far buddy... try to analyse the situations and business a bit and take my call. Don’t understand the options transaction and heard that ppl make hell lot of money from them but few get burnt badly as well, hence try to get slow and steady
1/25/21, 2:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Warrant is like a call option, with the same risks. However we can mitigate that by investing in best in class sponsors.  Time is also less of a factor as most would  have 12-24 mos to close the deal.
1/25/21, 2:48 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Yes true ..
1/25/21, 2:56 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yep, plus I am pretty sure you will let us know when to exit 😁😁
1/25/21, 3:23 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: :-), I like your style of booking the principal at 100% and let the house money run
1/25/21, 3:24 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: I like that too... Problem is none of my stocks reach 100%. 😂
1/25/21, 3:28 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Warrants can reach 100%
1/25/21, 3:28 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Pretty quickly
1/25/21, 3:29 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: All we need is some rumor in the market 😁
1/25/21, 3:41 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thank you. Bought some.
1/25/21, 3:43 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Part of the game. You can’t go right all the time...

1/25/21, 3:59 PM - +1 (347) 439-8391: Any feedback about SOS?
1/25/21, 4:07 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Just have been lucky with few penny stocks, all thanks to Anand Patel.
Few of my large investments are not doing that great, and the biggest blunder I did by selling my TSLA stocks which I held for 6 + months, learnt another lesson, we should never touch our winners!
1/25/21, 4:07 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 😔
1/25/21, 4:11 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Most of these stocks came as a recommendation from this group only, the key is to invest promptly.
1/25/21, 4:13 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: +1. And exit promptly. Either way loss or gain.
1/25/21, 4:13 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yepp, waiting for more rumours.
1/25/21, 4:13 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 👍
1/25/21, 4:14 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: It is moving in a range from long time. I sold it when it touched high.

1/26/21, 9:52 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: If you have too many then keep some long term and play with some after 60. Sell and buy on dip...But don’t sell all. It’s a good story for now.
1/26/21, 9:53 AM - +1 (336) 615-5435: I entered 60C two days back and today its 200% up

1/26/21, 10:18 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: purely depends on how BTC moves, BTC is very volatile and not sure if it has found bottom yet

1/26/21, 10:23 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Did you play options? The stock has been doing good right?
1/26/21, 10:24 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: SNPW. Up again today 50% so far. Again I have no idea. Entered with hundred $ and gained 1400% so far....Play with your risk and luck if you want to. Still in cents.
1/26/21, 10:28 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: What time?
1/26/21, 10:31 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Did enter post earnings crash at 127, as it got beaten that hard unnecessarily, plant based food is a huge revolution in the food industry it is here to stay, there partnership with PepsiCo to make plant based snack brought the stock to a new high.
1/26/21, 10:32 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yes bro... luckily yesterday only😎
1/26/21, 10:33 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I was about to buy on that day but could not decide and then out of sight out of mind....This was my favorite for over a year and have bought and sold few time for profit. Could not see this coming.
1/26/21, 10:33 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I also te- entered yesterday at 18.
1/26/21, 10:34 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👍🏻
1/26/21, 10:35 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: going up from last 2-3days
1/26/21, 10:35 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I guess TTCF has huge potential as well, you can add some for long term if not invested already
1/26/21, 10:35 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Reentry at this price should be ok. I was in at a higher price and unable to decide if buy more to average. Only so much I can put in one stock.
1/26/21, 10:38 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: You go to any grocery shop you will find their frozen food in abundance, waiting for their earning to smash wallstreet expectation and this will rocket too
1/26/21, 10:38 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I had entered at 24s and sold at 26s. I will buy today based on your recommendation. There is also a warrant trading at 12.92. Which one to buy? Stock or warrant?
1/26/21, 10:39 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: When is earning?
1/26/21, 10:39 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: 8th Feb
1/26/21, 10:40 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: ?
1/26/21, 10:40 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Stock or warrant?
1/26/21, 10:40 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Ok bought both 🙂.
1/26/21, 10:42 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It’s a stock
1/26/21, 10:42 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Not sure if you have warrant for tattooed chef

1/26/21, 10:48 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Warrant might still be floating. And I see an arbitrage opportunity. Assuming stock was for 11.50+12.95 warrant = 24.45. Vs stock price of 25.40. Buy warrant, convert and sell stock. You earn $1 right away. Do you know the process to convert warrant into share?
1/26/21, 10:55 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I am not sure, warrants I only started for SPACs suggested by Nash, rest I go with stocks

1/26/21, 2:44 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Anyone betting on BA?
1/26/21, 2:44 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: NDRA also going good today almost 3X for us.

1/26/21, 2:46 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👍🏻💃
1/26/21, 2:47 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: May be not. It should > 30 and then come down what I see
1/26/21, 2:47 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: T-Mobile is doing significantly better
1/26/21, 2:48 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 😢 But thank you.
1/26/21, 2:49 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: So it IYO sell at 30?
1/26/21, 2:50 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It’s a very stable company
1/26/21, 2:51 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: So the growth will be there in long run. 

T went up to 39$ in 52 Wand is writing at 28$

T-Mobile is trading at 52 weeks high almost at $132
1/26/21, 2:52 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It’s like Intel and AMD. Intel lost during this year whereas AMD made a kill
1/26/21, 2:53 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Both ATT and Intel are giant elephants. Take time to move. Whereas T-Mobile and AMD are agile and taking market share from the elephants
1/26/21, 2:53 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: AMD is now aggressively used by Crypto guys and gamers. Similarly T-Mobile is used by common public being significantly cheaper than ATT
1/26/21, 2:55 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: ATT is preferred by corporates for stability. The money is no more there as T-Mobile is taking the share. Again Sprint merger added to T-Mobile customer base quite a bit.
1/26/21, 3:04 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I added Conversion Lab yesterday at slightly above $12. It skyrocketed today, but can be added on a retracement for long term. Its a mini teladoc, and we can talk more about the similarities and differences. Keep an eye on this.
1/26/21, 3:04 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: CVLB
1/26/21, 3:13 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Yes I have and holding for next run

1/26/21, 3:34 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: hmm...will wait for a dip then
1/26/21, 3:34 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: And the fact that they have not lost yet.... once 50% loose their savings they will learn what it means to tame the market
1/26/21, 3:34 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: BEAR 3B money in short and BULL try to pull up. So BEAR book loss
1/26/21, 3:35 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: This fight will continue till BEAR not book loss
1/26/21, 3:38 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Wnw good to enter now ? @nash @anand , it's down from 77 in dec 2020 to 22

1/26/21, 4:30 PM - Lalmani BJANA: I wasn't expecting GME to go so high in a day. So I bought in the morning and put a high limit to sell. It got fulfilled before EOD. I notice it has been marked as Day trader transaction. Will there be any consequences after 3 such txn?
1/26/21, 4:31 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: This is unsustainable..... whoever are the retailers pumping in frenzy will see it come down to 60.... may be not right away, but in a month or two
1/26/21, 4:33 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Till Bear have position it will go crazy. Bear need to buy stock and stock price is UP. Look like TESLA TYPE
1/26/21, 4:34 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: yes...in couple of weeks link WNW 🙂

1/26/21, 5:12 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: ALL have high shorts volume
1/26/21, 5:13 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Lets find out more stocks with high short volume and go for a bull run. Looks like musk shared his shorts to others as well :)

1/26/21, 9:27 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Cinema halls or TV channel
1/26/21, 9:30 PM - +1 (201) 208-1249: AMC. It went up 66% after trading hours.
1/26/21, 9:30 PM - +1 (201) 208-1249: <Media omitted>
1/26/21, 9:30 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: It's big game going on in the market right now.
1/26/21, 9:30 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: No fundamentals. No technicals. No sense.
1/26/21, 9:31 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Gme what’s the short expiry- this Friday?
1/26/21, 9:46 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Only 1 fundamental: find most shorted stock and take to the moon. Create most fear inside short seller 😜😜
1/26/21, 9:47 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: If you ask me shorting should not be allowed. Why should you be able to sell something you don't have?
1/26/21, 9:50 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: I am not talking about legal or illegal.. right now this is happening in the market... it’s started from TESLA and going to each most shorted stock.
1/26/21, 9:51 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Yes. And I'm not blaming you for shorting if you short. It's legal.
1/26/21, 9:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Fubo seems to be the strongest fundamentally in this list.
1/26/21, 9:53 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: I had AMC 1000 stocks and sold today 😟
1/26/21, 9:53 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: But now it’s not the fundamentals... it’s wherever the mass applies the push... 🙂
1/26/21, 9:53 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Bad day
1/26/21, 9:54 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: No way to know, atleast with fundamentals, you will not get killed
1/26/21, 9:54 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If GME comes down, it is never going back up again
1/26/21, 9:54 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: I also have 1000 but I sold covered call of $5.50 😢😢
1/26/21, 9:55 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: That’s true... some will loose savings... while some will go laughing to bank.... hope is hedge funds loose and most retailers go happy... since it’s over 100% short
1/26/21, 9:56 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: GME - what i heard from other source” that GME is supplying its secret tech behind “Need for Speed” and “Asphalt 8” to Tesla, Nio and Nikola. That is the core reason reflecting in market price. Soon it will cross TSLA market cap 🤯🤯🤯
1/26/21, 9:56 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Had I read about this mess earlier, cud have made good quick buck.. lost the bus and now am a chicken😳

1/26/21, 10:04 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Asphalt 8 is a racing video game by Gameloft, not sure how Gamestop which is a dying brick and mortar store came into picture.
1/26/21, 10:05 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Chamath bough call options joining reddit folks which further acted as a trigger.

1/26/21, 10:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Fizz has flat revenues over the last couple of years. Next year estimate is 5% growth. It's pretty ordinary from my quick look.

1/27/21, 2:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep market tanks, they will tank given the speculative nature. However today pricing won't matter. We only need good appreciation on the day of merger to make good out of these
1/27/21, 2:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Also sponsors have vested interest in the warrants at $1.5, so anytime they go below 1.5-2.0 can be good to accumulate more if folks want to take more risk
1/27/21, 2:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They trade between 1.5-2.0

1/27/21, 6:40 PM - +1 (917) 406-2999: Worst day or rather continuity from yesterday for almost all stocks except GME, AMC and koss

1/27/21, 6:42 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: As per Nash from previous communications looks like we are still in bull market, unless any chanhes. Lets hold tight.

1/27/21, 6:49 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I have a good time horizon of 2-3 years for my long term stocks, getting skeptical that if the market crashes after deploying my cash in these stocks, I will have nothing to do then just watch them fall
1/27/21, 6:53 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Having some cash buffer is a good idea. Though i completely understand seeing in red hurts when u didnt book profit. I am in same boat but holding for future
1/27/21, 6:54 PM - +1 (310) 748-7761: Looks like wall street bets channel removed from Reddit

1/27/21, 6:57 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yepp might have to book profit at the right time, identifying the right time is tricky though , let’s see might learn with time.
1/27/21, 7:02 PM - +1 (732) 331-3713: Sure.. Agreed.. Also allowing more shorts than available stocks itself is not a valid case. If that's legal then squeezing them through a community is legal too.. Doesn't matter how the community is formed.

1/27/21, 7:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Looks like a bad day today, and it's entirely possible a trend may have changed for the short term, however doesn't change the narrative of a bull market. 3550-3660 seems to be the level if it continues going down. Worst case we are at 3400, but these levels will turn out to be buying opportunities. Best of luck.
1/27/21, 7:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: We shouldn't end this bull market until we are at 4500 per my calculation, may be higher
1/27/21, 7:26 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash, will increase my cash position to be on safer side
1/27/21, 7:31 PM - +1 (732) 331-3713: 🙏
1/27/21, 7:44 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: One more thing Nash, what are you doing with FVRR at the current levels, are you adding more in this dip or you booked profit when it was at 260s. 
If you booked profit at 260s, how do you track it, I remember you booked profit in TTD as well at 870 levels.
In nutshell, looking forward to some guidance on long term investment profit booking and also where do you deploy that cash, do keep it in sidelines and wait for a dip in the same stock or you deploy it in any stock which falls.
Also, when do you rebuild that position which you lose after selling the stock of it doesn’t come down.....
Apologies for so many queries, thanks 🙏
1/27/21, 7:52 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am not doing anything in Fiverr. I was up in TTD over 300% and it became a heavy position for me to trim down.

1/27/21, 7:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: For adding position, I only do when it looks really good, and sometime I miss it like what happened at Zoom at 325

1/27/21, 8:04 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Got it, thanks.
so, basically I should have a target amount in my mind and book profit arnd that for my long positions as well, I can’t just keep them growing just because it is a long term investment .
1/27/21, 8:05 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I do remember that😁 I caught it arnd 350. 
Not much difference though it’s still at 370 levels.
1/27/21, 8:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: There is no harm in taking gravy out from time to time, however we should hold it as long as the story doest change. For eg. Teladoc made a high of 250, came down to 180 and I said it looks really good. Now it's 280 and flying. Same thing happened with Fastly. Stock may run into consolidation for a couple of months and gives opportunity to add, and it will then go even higher than their previous levels.

1/27/21, 8:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: We need stocks to deliver  accelerated growth, move into new areas, hire best talent. If comanies do the right thing, it doesn't matter where market is in 10-20 yrs, your stock will be a 10+ bagger
1/27/21, 8:16 PM - +1 (732) 397-9588: That means AAPL msft nflx are good buys even after today's drop
1/27/21, 8:17 PM - +1 (732) 397-9588: Perhaps can add during the dips in next few days
1/27/21, 8:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: These are evergreen stocks, but will not deliver my 10x return that I am looking for
1/27/21, 8:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: in 10 yrs
1/27/21, 8:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: A company needs to be also smaller in relative to its Total addressable market for it to reach where you want it to reaxh
1/27/21, 8:18 PM - +1 (732) 397-9588: Makes sense
1/27/21, 8:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The early you find the company the better the prospect of a 10x bagger, which is why I am excited for all of my stocks which are under 10 billion

1/27/21, 8:22 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: 3 of the hedge funds most likely will go bankrupt in couple of days due to AMC, GME and few others
1/27/21, 8:23 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: So the money anyone is making is because of their bankruptcy. It’s an insane story 😃
1/27/21, 8:23 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Excellent strategy Nash!
1/27/21, 8:36 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Right, I miss completely on profit booking, it is a niche strategy and I guess with learn with time only. As not to touch your high conviction winners is equally important, as I booked profit on my biggest position which I was holding since May “TSLA” post S&P inclusion which I regret now, it’s a complex game I guess, but let’s see...
1/27/21, 8:40 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: CVLB and DMNR are your recent long term investment picks right? Could you name few more which are your high conviction long term investments?
1/27/21, 8:46 PM - +1 (732) 397-9588: Great insight Nash. Thanks!
1/27/21, 8:46 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I guess VERY is another one, but I am heavily invested in TTCF and BYND so will give it a pass.
1/27/21, 8:47 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: A list of these stocks will be great Nash!

Can't believe my bad luck 😭😂....I sold 100 AMC stocks at $4.80 just hours before this all started...completely oblivious to what folks at wallstreetbets were planning :)

1/27/21, 9:00 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Hard luck buddy! I too almost entered yesterday at 4.6 with my 1k to gamble but then refrained myself, and the funny thing is I was aware that it was the second most shorted stock and can come to action anytime ... still have it a miss ... 1k would have turned to 5k today, but this is part of game.
1/27/21, 9:00 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: So today I put my 5k to the 3rd most shorted stock, let’s see what happens tomorrow

1/27/21, 11:28 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: VERY.CN would be for Canada, as I live in Canada so put it that ways, but yes for US it’s VRYYF. 
Also, as I am invested in BYND and TTCF so might be another reason 😜😜

For long term like Enphase more than SEDG, Cloudfare more than fastly. Hive is a swing crypto play, Draftking is also a swing play for now (but may change). Rest all look good
1/28/21, 7:57 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Added IPOE at slightly above $18. They are acquiring SOFI. So, Adyen Afterpay and SOFI are fintech plays for long term (may include affirm but not now)

1/28/21, 10:43 AM - +1 (703) 388-8466: They are manipulating the market openly. If some billionaire investor did that with his money power he would be in jail. So anybody who is manipulating the market openly or closely is wrong. Even if label then small or retail investors.
1/28/21, 10:46 AM - +1 (703) 388-8466: Ethics 101 guys
1/28/21, 10:48 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: RH was always considered to be millenials app based on pump and dump happening last year, this is surprising.
1/28/21, 10:51 AM - +1 (401) 556-8301: How do we sell then ? RH is not allowing to sell DOGE.
1/28/21, 10:51 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: NH is up today
1/28/21, 10:53 AM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Lot of ppl will dump RH after today

1/28/21, 10:59 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You call it manipulation, I call it social investing. How is it different than pooling funds like ETF to bet on a stock. If they are transparent, they are manipulating. Hedge funds are not transparent and they do it all day behind closed doors. It's easy to label someone
1/28/21, 10:59 AM - +1 (860) 333-2568: 👌👌👌 well said
1/28/21, 11:00 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: How is it different than IB sending notes to billionaire clients to buy a stock
1/28/21, 11:00 AM - +1 (703) 388-8466: I said anybody who does that is wrong. Did I say hedge funds who do are correct ?? It’s unethical.
1/28/21, 11:00 AM - +1 (703) 388-8466: Social investing 😂😂
1/28/21, 11:01 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: What is unethical about writing your investment thesis in social media. You don't control who will buy what?
1/28/21, 11:01 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: All of us are unethical in that sense
1/28/21, 11:01 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Well if you can’t buy then whom you are selling to?
1/28/21, 11:03 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I sold all my AMC stocks
1/28/21, 11:05 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: 👍

1/28/21, 11:12 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: yeah but my price is still far....I may have to wait for couple of more weeks.

1/28/21, 11:33 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: This manipulation was too much... the stress was coming on other good stocks like aapl etc.. to sell those to cover gme positions...
1/28/21, 11:33 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Social investing became too greedy... taking gme from 20 to 500...

1/28/21, 2:17 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Such irrational rises should crash... that’s what keep things under control
1/28/21, 2:18 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It’s a coin 🪙 and there is a new word coinrational 😃
1/28/21, 2:18 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: The Mindless game 😃
1/28/21, 2:19 PM - +1 (201) 456-7921: 225% up..
1/28/21, 2:19 PM - +1 (347) 439-8391: Any idea how much will it go? Is it right time to enter?
1/28/21, 2:20 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: lol i am too biased on MAra from 1.41 so i will let others share opinion :)
1/28/21, 2:20 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: You are the best guide for mara
1/28/21, 2:21 PM - +1 (781) 774-0196: Dogecoin doesn't have limited supply like the others. It keeps mining and is essentially unlimited supply. I'd be surprised if they can get it to $10
1/28/21, 2:21 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: not even 1$
1/28/21, 2:22 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: if they make it to even 5, i am sure half of this group will retire LOL
1/28/21, 2:22 PM - +1 (781) 774-0196: Yea was just giving WSB some space lol
1/28/21, 2:23 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: With 100% rise today, is it worth entering now?
1/28/21, 2:23 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: With gme approach, it can go to moon never know
1/28/21, 2:24 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: usually i have seen it makes 50/70% dip easily 

today itself went to 0.028 to 0.017
1/28/21, 2:24 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: so averaging at dips, i would suggest
1/28/21, 2:24 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Does webull have any restriction on stocks?
1/28/21, 2:25 PM - +1 (781) 774-0196: Currently have a position with 0.0087 entry that I got in before all this madness. But wont be adding anything
1/28/21, 2:25 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: That’s a cool 3 times👏👏👏👍👍👍
1/28/21, 2:27 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: No issues in webull that i have noticed
1/28/21, 2:27 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Thanks

1/28/21, 2:43 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Buts isn’t RH providing free service? No commission- so they can determine what to offer what not
1/28/21, 2:44 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Free service is every where now
1/28/21, 2:47 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Nope, see how much they charge per sale and multiply with # of transactions. They now make hell of money every day
1/28/21, 2:47 PM - +1 (860) 839-6893: Doge 🚀
1/28/21, 2:56 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Rocket down... not up
1/28/21, 2:58 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: It is not free.. they apply regulatory charges which are nominal
1/28/21, 2:59 PM - +1 (303) 569-6446: <Media omitted>
1/28/21, 2:59 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Was coming down good... but reversed
1/28/21, 3:01 PM - +1 (860) 839-6893: Anything can happen as btc is going up

1/28/21, 3:33 PM - +1 (917) 406-2999: Yeah I did buy few and it’s positive from my buy
1/28/21, 3:33 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: ok

1/28/21, 3:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Added at the right time, if they start loving this
1/28/21, 3:52 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Better to but IPOE or its warrant?
1/28/21, 3:54 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Long term ipoe. I did not read the warrant docs, but they may have right to redeem it if trades above 18 like others
1/28/21, 3:54 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: It's already over $8
1/28/21, 3:55 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: $7*
1/28/21, 3:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah sounds about righy
1/28/21, 3:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Shares trade above 18
1/28/21, 3:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not warrant
1/28/21, 3:56 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Ipoe - 20.02 right now
1/28/21, 3:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Above 18 for 20 of the 30 days
1/28/21, 3:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not all will exercise their right, because it would mean dilution
1/28/21, 3:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: But some companies don't like warrants hanging around
1/28/21, 3:58 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: So does this mean better to but IPOE
1/28/21, 3:58 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Instead of warrant?
1/28/21, 3:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Long term stocks are better
1/28/21, 3:58 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Agreed
1/28/21, 3:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Unless you have a significant arbitrage
1/28/21, 3:58 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: They're trying to do all the things that a traditional bank is doing today. Banks historically never delivered consistently. They may grow books aggressively and show growth but it is all capital intensive and bad loans are dangerous for small banks
1/28/21, 3:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Capitol is cheap if they become a bank
1/28/21, 3:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Cost of lending goes down significantly
1/28/21, 4:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Vs fintech player
1/28/21, 4:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Who relies on equity
1/28/21, 4:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Got to go
1/28/21, 4:00 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Wow :)
1/28/21, 4:04 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Only if they get free money stashed in checking accounts but their focus is on loan refinance and maybe tough to get free digital accounts competing with banks and apps like G-Pay or other big digital wallets
1/28/21, 4:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Marcus, Ally and a number of others are all digital banks providing high interest rate. The cost of operating a brick and mortar store is passed on to the customer.
1/28/21, 4:18 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Who goes to the bank these days, while an online high saving account is very attractive. You also have the Fed printing money at almost 0 rate, which channels on the market through the banking system
1/28/21, 4:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: What I am simply saying is the cost of borrowing for a bank is very cheap vs cost of equity, which will be an enabler for SOFI
1/28/21, 4:26 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: <Media omitted>
1/28/21, 4:26 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Citigroup has least brick and mortar presence among big banks and they're coming with all digital account in Google pay. I agree with lower borrowing costs for bank but aggressive loan growth killed many in the past
1/28/21, 4:26 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: ICICI suffered the same vs HDFC in India
1/28/21, 4:27 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Now we are making an assumption that SOFI is bad at lending vs the traditional banks
1/28/21, 4:27 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Or they would not be able to manage the growth
1/28/21, 4:27 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Sofi valuation is based on 6x growth in 5yrs
1/28/21, 4:28 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Point noted, it's a risk, but is not an atypical risk for the industry
1/28/21, 4:29 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I love that and trust Chamath. How about a 3x growth. It still will outperform in Wall Street
1/28/21, 4:29 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: All banks in Wall St
1/28/21, 4:30 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Give it to me i will shift all my bank accounts to Sofi
1/28/21, 4:31 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: 3x growth will not make it a case for the valuation they're pushing for
1/28/21, 4:31 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I like to buy stuff from the stocks I have (Amazon, Shop merchants, etsy, will use Sofi instead of Marcus if they come with a high interest saving account)
1/28/21, 4:41 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: <Media omitted>
1/28/21, 4:47 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Can't compare with traditional banks. It's fintech with pretty good margins.
1/28/21, 4:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If you talk about valuations, how do you justify, snowflake, tesla and everything else in the market today
1/28/21, 4:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It seems pretty cheap to me
1/28/21, 4:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I won't be surprised of 300% (3x) return in 5 yrs
1/28/21, 4:50 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: 👍 wanted to alert on risks.
1/28/21, 4:53 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I place a lot of emphasis in management. When the best of the best say something or personally invest their hard equity, that's a tell. I find SOFIs management and investors exceptional.
1/28/21, 4:54 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The onus is on them to be half right for what they have said and still make plenty for shareholders

1/28/21, 6:25 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: See Deepak bhai entered when it was 0.003. Now it is 0.03
1/28/21, 6:30 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Entered this morning at .012

1/28/21, 6:33 PM - +1 (949) 294-4736: Hey guys .. just a gentle and friendly request if we want to limit the chat here to stock as the group intends to.
1/28/21, 6:34 PM - +1 (949) 294-4736: With 500 - 1000 messages, the real messages will be lost unfortunately
1/28/21, 6:34 PM - +1 (949) 294-4736: Not to hurt anyone but let’s have this Channel purpose be met
1/28/21, 6:35 PM - +1 (917) 375-5298: Focus 10-15 stocks max, set your rules and work on it. No need to read any 500-1000 message. 😊
1/28/21, 6:36 PM - +1 (949) 294-4736: Yeah but interesting convo won’t be read if there are 500-1000 messages !
1/28/21, 6:37 PM - +1 (949) 294-4736: Fortunately or unfortunately I’m skipping all 1000 😳
1/28/21, 6:38 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Pls buy Dogecoin and join the fun 😃 atleast for today. We don’t know tomorrow if it will tank
1/28/21, 6:40 PM - +1 (949) 294-4736: I was looking for Commentary on spac but gave up 😜
1/28/21, 6:40 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: This might take it to 5 cents in the next 12 hours. At that point I'll sell half my position.
1/28/21, 6:41 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Chat search can give you

1/28/21, 6:47 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: In the same boat. Many times I lose track of the discussion. If I have time, I go back and start reading the thread. If not, just clear the chat 😄.
1/28/21, 6:47 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Crossed .032
1/28/21, 6:48 PM - +1 (917) 578-2068: Elon Musk 😃..just kidding
1/28/21, 6:51 PM - +1 (972) 693-4283: Where did you buy dogecoin ? It’s not on coinbase though
1/28/21, 6:54 PM - +1 (972) 693-4283: Coins are super risky.
1/28/21, 6:55 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: RH
1/28/21, 6:55 PM - +1 (860) 839-6893: RH
1/28/21, 6:55 PM - +1 (860) 839-6893: Better take out what you invested in doge just to be on safe side
1/28/21, 6:58 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: 4 cents 🐕
1/28/21, 6:59 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Looks like buying is causing issue.

1/28/21, 7:01 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Who knows, in this madness 🤣

1/29/21, 11:51 AM - +1 (860) 986-8967: Just learnt.. This guy who is actually behind the short squeeze is called Keith better known as King on wsb.
He is from Brockton Mass - live next doors to some of us who lives in Boston.
And it’s not a one day story ... he has been telling this coming from august on his YouTube channel when GME WAS 4$ .... he invested 15000$ in this stock which became 50 million at one time & he is still in the game.
His positions moved from 50 million to 25 to 10 million to back up in one week & he is still holding. People @wsb gathering faith & strength thru him.

1/29/21, 3:57 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Copy paste from hacker news:

The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation settles most listed securities transactions in America; in 2011, it did $1.7 quadrillion [1]. You've never heard of it unless you're a professional trader, but it's actually quite fascinating to read up on.

Trading looks instantaneous. But settlement takes a few days. In between are a series of credit agreements. From your broker to you. From the clearinghouse to the brokers. DTCC is the clearinghouse. Robinhood is the broker.

There are rules and contracts between DTCC and its members, including Robinhood [2]. Those contracts ensure that when you buy shares through your broker from a Robinhood customer, if Robinhood falls down two days later, there is collateral sufficient to make you whole. Those collateral requirements change in reference to, amongst other things, the volatility of the security. (If a broker falls down, the clearinghouse liquidates their collateral and makes their counterparty whole. More volatility means more chance the collateral will be insufficient.)

In this case, collateral requirements on GME went up. Because of its volatility. So while before Robinhood had to pony up collateral for a few shares of GME for every hundred it traded, it now had to, at close of business, pony up one hundred shares' worth of collateral for every hundred it traded. That creates a cash crunch. One that exacerbates itself with every additional trade in the security. If Robinhood fails to satisfy those collateral calls, they go out of business overnight. Into receivership. Done.

Most brokers have policies for these situations. Higher brokerage fees for securities on a schedule. Not making shares and cash from trades available until the trade settles, sort of like what banks do for large cheques. But I don't know if Robinhood is able to do that quickly. So instead they pulled the plug.

1/29/21, 6:44 PM - +1 (860) 986-8967: Fidelity allows 7-9am pre market and not from 4am onwards ( as webull) but allows full post market hours  4-8 pm trading.
1/29/21, 6:49 PM - +1 (404) 904-7738: Schwab allows pre-market (7-9) and post-market (4-8.30) trading.
1/29/21, 7:45 PM - +1 (732) 799-8114: E*TRADE as well
1/29/21, 7:46 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: And Merrill too
1/29/21, 8:09 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Merrill does allow extended hour trading but not like webull, webull allows me to buy starting 4 am. If a yone needs a refferal to webull feel free to ping me.
1/29/21, 8:11 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I cant do that in Schwab. Do you need to have a certain type of account?
1/29/21, 8:27 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: For me Webull doesn’t allow to place options order before 8 am , not sure why
1/29/21, 8:31 PM - +1 (404) 904-7738: Dunno. Will check and let you all know.

1/29/21, 8:35 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I did once. There is a different tab for extended hours trading. It only accepts limit orders.
1/29/21, 8:41 PM - +1 (404) 904-7738: If you select limit order in Schwab, the extended hour is enabled. Here are some more details:

1/29/21, 9:24 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: For those who experienced some issues on RH today, it's explained here : " On Friday morning, Robinhood initially eased restrictions on the volatile stocks, allowing more purchases, and their values began to rise. But as the day wore on and trading volumes increased, it restricted users to only buying a single share of the restricted stocks, and expanded the list from 13 to over 50.

The back and forth has all been too much for some users, who posted messages saying they were switching to other apps and brokerages. Rival no-fee stock trading app Webull surged to the number two slot in the Apple App Store.  "

1/29/21, 10:05 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: It is  at $0.039 better buy option as it was before. I bought at $0.028

1/29/21, 10:21 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Does it execute when market is closed?
1/29/21, 10:22 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Execution will happen only once market opens
1/29/21, 10:22 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: But you can place order any time
1/29/21, 10:23 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: U think it will go $10? It will beat bitcoin then .
1/29/21, 10:26 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Ok, the brokers i use allow this as well.

1/30/21, 8:06 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Somehow the world gets crazy, there is still a chance of $1. At $10, it will be $1.2 TN or the entire market cap of crypto, or equivalent to the GDP of a number of small countries, 40% of India's GDP :-)

1/30/21, 9:57 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Correct. I don't even expect it to be $1 and that was the general consensus until last week. Now with this rise it seems to have changed. 
Over $1T for Dogecoin is unreal. But so was Tesla going to $800B if you thought 2 years ago. Although Tesla did great things and is expected to become one of the greatest in the world over the next decade and Dogecoin has nothing going for it except frenzy in last few days. We have seen unreal things happen in the markets. 
I still don't think it will reach even 40 cents but I also don't want to have a lifetime regret be selling at 4 cents if it hits $1 or something crazy like that!
1/30/21, 9:57 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: I agree

I use webull (and like it better for charts) and I use vanguard because of my IRA and the app is a crap..
1/30/21, 11:18 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I started using Webull I don’t like it. It’s like WhatsApp Vs rest :(
1/30/21, 11:18 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: May be I’m biased because I only know RH and Webull

1/30/21, 11:29 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: @17325013097  Bhai you being the admin of the group and @12015655130 Bhai being the finest advisor of the group should give us referral for the best app you think we should move. That way you get some rewards 🙏🏽
1/30/21, 11:30 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Good you tubers make 20-30K$ only from referral per month
1/30/21, 11:30 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Not that you want to make money but it’s a fair thing
1/30/21, 11:31 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Thinkorswim is the best I know so far. It is a TDA app.
1/30/21, 11:33 AM - +1 (732) 692-7507: Sachin bhai you are absolutely right all Refferal should go to Nash, Anand Gupta and Anand Patel . They are the one who give all their valuable time
1/30/21, 11:34 AM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Is anyone in the group have YouTube channel ?

1/30/21, 11:45 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: When I asked for RH referral 3 people immediately private messaged me because they wanted their free stock. And they don't even comment on the group. I would rather give it to somebody who positively contributes to the group not people who just listen in (nothing wrong with that) and don't even send a thank you when they make money with somebody's recommendation.

I'll move to my basement before buying any stock.
1/30/21, 11:50 AM - +1 (404) 904-7738: Schwab is giving funds to new accounts, not the referrer. It might be a good idea to make a little bit of money. Posting the reward tiers again.

1/30/21, 12:07 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: It is frustrating to see it give back 75% of the gain...isliye during pump time it is better to exit
1/30/21, 12:08 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Then if we really like the stock/coin we can buyback when it settles down
1/30/21, 12:09 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Doge was pure pump thought..but arguments can be made as we don't know how high it can go..
1/30/21, 12:10 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: On paper and dreams they always seem to make you millionaire..like doge 100k doge with 10$ ..millionaire ban gaye
1/30/21, 12:11 PM - +1 (972) 693-4283: Coins have no basis of their price , so just trade and exit with money. No long term plan.
1/30/21, 12:11 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Even if you are hold for 1$ which it may ..i don't know..but it won't be straight up

1/30/21, 12:17 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: 😃

1/30/21, 12:19 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Why? What wrong did he do
1/30/21, 12:19 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: He has history of creating non sensical statements....
1/30/21, 12:20 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: By that logic anybody coming on CNBC and saying this stock is good or that stock is bad should not be allowed to say so either as it shapes public opinion.
1/30/21, 12:20 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Every share he tweets would go viral. People buy buy buy buy. Then it fades away
1/30/21, 12:20 PM - +1 (972) 693-4283: If you want to buy coins then 
XLM , LTC, ETH are stable in market. Better for future.
1/30/21, 12:20 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: That’s what is to be investigated😀 will keep him in reins

1/30/21, 12:23 PM - +1 (972) 693-4283: Ya true. But we should strictly follow him and exit when our need is done. 😃
1/30/21, 12:27 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: I think we should keep watch on his profile picture in Twitter. Jo bol raha hai woh rocket ho raha hai 😀
1/30/21, 12:27 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Yes we should do that
1/30/21, 12:27 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Exit karna important hai
1/30/21, 12:28 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Because it’s a bubble market for these ones
1/30/21, 12:28 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: What Nash recommends are based on fundamentals. 9 of 10 times will make money

1/30/21, 12:31 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: @Nash why don’t you start YouTube channel or some forum like that Reddit guy?

1/30/21, 3:01 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: It will bounce when all weak hand out in this BULL squeeze
1/30/21, 3:10 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: That is what I am feeling and holding it but there is no solid evidence. I am holding it as well. Expecting there will be bounce next week

1/31/21, 6:49 AM - Lalmani BJANA: So is SLV good to buy?

1/31/21, 7:50 AM - +1 (757) 285-8122: I have been using Sofi for some time now and with RH issues I guess many investors are looking around for better options. 

Here is my referral in case you would like to switch. 

Hey! I'm using SoFi Invest 📊 to buy and sell stocks (and pieces of stocks) with zero fees. Open an Active Investing account with $1,000 or more, and you'll get $50 in stock. I'll get $50 in stock, too! Use my link: https://www.sofi.com/share/invest/2506220
1/31/21, 7:56 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I own SLV and expect it to perform well in the short to medium term.
1/31/21, 10:33 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Do you guys think sears ($0.45) or JC PENNY ($0.12) can still recover? Not sure if they are worthy of looking at.
1/31/21, 10:38 AM - +1 (401) 556-8301: May be if wallstreetbets pump it too .. :)
1/31/21, 10:39 AM - +1 (201) 673-2921: 😀
1/31/21, 10:53 AM - +1 (404) 432-7444: We need to start desistreetbets..😜
1/31/21, 10:54 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 😅
1/31/21, 10:55 AM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Jagx looks the favorite for everyone here
1/31/21, 10:56 AM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Jagx first target 😁
1/31/21, 11:06 AM - +1 (856) 408-8842: https://www.reddit.com/r/JAGX/
1/31/21, 11:07 AM - +1 (856) 408-8842: They already have group for jagx and planning to but Monday not many memebers though
1/31/21, 11:14 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 👍🏻😂
1/31/21, 11:22 AM - +1 (401) 556-8301: Dogecoin mein jyada members hain though
1/31/21, 11:22 AM - +1 (401) 556-8301: If it’s seriously going to be pushed to even 10 cents, we could buy more and hold ...any intel please share here ..
1/31/21, 11:23 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Yup. We keep hearing about the past how much British looted Bharat, but this is happening even today. And I am sad that we are also part of this.
1/31/21, 11:31 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Sears NO NO. management is not serious about business. They have not invested any $ in their stores for many years. All cream viz. Real estate and licenses has been carved out of Sear’s. There is nothing left in there. JCPenny survival is difficult as well. But my. Retail in general is doing bad except 2nd tier retailer viz Ross, TJMax etc.
1/31/21, 11:38 AM - +1 (401) 556-8301: This is a impeccable analysis point of view which certainly is core technique to judge a stock but in the era of online forums, pumpers and dumpers like wallstreetbets, etc, anything is possible ..?  A group is of 7.4 M members 338K online right now, they can shake a mountain ...
1/31/21, 11:40 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Surprised JCP is only 12 cents. It can have some positive news. Restructuring, Amazon, funding etc.
1/31/21, 11:45 AM - +1 (717) 385-7085: Sears and JCP stores are getting closed phased wise. What do we expect? Some Javed Miadaad will come ans hit 6 on last ball 😉😉😉
1/31/21, 11:54 AM - +1 (917) 544-3061: JCP has some hope. Sears doesn't.
1/31/21, 12:24 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: I am expecting something big on doge coming Monday.  I may be wrong but based on other groups discussion looks like once RH and other apps allow investing newly transferred money, doge will go high again.
1/31/21, 12:28 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Possible hai
1/31/21, 12:45 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Bitcoin will come down to 31500 - 32000 and then possible will hit 38000-39500 .

1/31/21, 1:03 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: If we get this fact we will earn almost $5-6k every week. 🙂
1/31/21, 1:28 PM - +1 (972) 693-4283: Risk involved 😊
1/31/21, 1:35 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Looks like already started
1/31/21, 1:38 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Doge 🚀🚀🚀
1/31/21, 1:42 PM - +1 (401) 556-8301: I put additional funds in RH to buy more DOGE but RH is not making funds available for crypto right away
1/31/21, 1:51 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Yeah they started doing from Friday
1/31/21, 1:52 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Now it might be risky to invest
1/31/21, 1:53 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Game on for Doge
1/31/21, 1:53 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Madness started again
1/31/21, 1:53 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Yeah enjoy the ride

1/31/21, 2:04 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: RH not allowing to add money in crypto
1/31/21, 2:05 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Yea they did send out a message that you'll have to wait for deposit to settle
1/31/21, 2:06 PM - +1 (401) 556-8301: Haan yeah saw that
1/31/21, 2:11 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Lot of bag holders will try to exit..sobbe carefull
1/31/21, 2:14 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Not yet... It should reach .06  - .08
1/31/21, 2:32 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Hope by evening
1/31/21, 2:32 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Based on trends
1/31/21, 2:36 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: 👍
1/31/21, 2:53 PM - Niteen: What's the safest bet for dogecoin 😃
1/31/21, 2:59 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Anything below .030
1/31/21, 2:59 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Based on recent trends

1/31/21, 4:19 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: may be its a good idea to start mining Doge coins instead of buying 🙂
1/31/21, 4:20 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: 👍
1/31/21, 4:27 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: If it sustains till coming Wednesday...it will definitely cross $1.

Many users waiting to invest who will get their money by Wed/Thurs 

There are many groups where people are already planning for Wed and Thur. Targeted date and investment. 
Don't know where it will go now.
1/31/21, 4:28 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Should we hold till next week ?
1/31/21, 4:32 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: I will...increased my stake more at $.030

1/31/21, 6:45 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Don’t worry this is due to GME . Major hedge fund manager selling other stock to buy back GME shorted stock with loss
1/31/21, 6:46 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: They have to cover most shorted stock on Monday
1/31/21, 6:57 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Can anyone tell me how to buy neuralink stocks IPO?
1/31/21, 6:59 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: You following musk tweet , i recently started following 😀

1/31/21, 7:37 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I think we should not panic. What has happened is that there had been massive selling of top S&P stocks and invested into 4-5 Reddit fueled ones. Good or bad, that is the reason
1/31/21, 7:38 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I see that Dogecoin has resistance at 0.034ish. Not going down below this.
1/31/21, 7:42 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: This message was deleted
1/31/21, 7:43 PM - +1 (408) 396-9658: :-)
1/31/21, 7:45 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: This is a good video, 3 weeks old. Talks about history of the coin and details. If you have time, may like to listen 

https://youtu.be/iP0B9MKpSy8
1/31/21, 7:55 PM - +1 (973) 405-0388: Good opportunity to buy everything we have in our watchlist at discount  until GME tanks and billions come back in the market. Wall Street probably also loves these dips to buy more !
1/31/21, 7:56 PM - +1 (910) 535-5555: How do you time the bottom? Just curious 🤨
1/31/21, 7:56 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: True but we need money to buy at discounted price. For that we need to cashout some profitable stocks.
Lets see howz tomorrow's market.
1/31/21, 7:57 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Yes this is another challenge.
1/31/21, 8:17 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Tomorrow will be a big red Monday I think.
1/31/21, 8:21 PM - +1 (973) 405-0388: A safe recommendation would be to chart previous broken resistances and tested support levels. And scale in at each time a precious support is broken. (Only for stocks you fundamentally believe in ) 
Another way would be to hedge with puts for the same stock or sympathy plays until you see a reversal and rise in futures in the market or sectors
1/31/21, 8:22 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: So what are good stocks we should be looking to buys on discounted price ?
1/31/21, 8:36 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: MSFT in 225-230 range. It is looking stronger in big tech
1/31/21, 8:42 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Ok
1/31/21, 8:43 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Any thought for Atos? I heard it will rise high as one patent pending fda approval .. high chance of approval
1/31/21, 9:04 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Suggestion - Stay away from FB, will be roasted in next few days
1/31/21, 9:04 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: FB stocks I mean
1/31/21, 9:04 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Thx Sachin 👍
1/31/21, 9:05 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Apple 14.4 version will destroy FB
1/31/21, 9:05 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: FB will have hindrances to get data from Apple devices, FB will sue apple. Apple says device is mine and data is mine
1/31/21, 9:06 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Mark Z has started crying, the war is open. Apple is a clear winner
1/31/21, 9:08 PM - +1 (630) 280-1814: 🤣🤣
1/31/21, 9:08 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: U think AAPL will later start a service and make users pay for data privacy?
1/31/21, 9:09 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Wait and watch :) I am loving it
1/31/21, 9:10 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: 😊 either users pay for iPrivacy or they'll sell it to FB and make money?
1/31/21, 9:10 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I doubt if they say it explicitly, but increase the device price. The device price include all 😄
1/31/21, 9:10 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: As long as there is no competitor
1/31/21, 9:12 PM - +1 (972) 989-0421: AAPL has already monetised google searches... now they wud like to do it with FB..
1/31/21, 9:14 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: yes. Google already pays a lot to be default search engine
1/31/21, 9:26 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Google pays a lot of companies lot of money to be the default search engine.

1/31/21, 10:59 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: My 6th grade daughter just asked me,”Daddy what happened to GameStop”? Because some other kid brought it up in her debate practice... And I was like WOW...So such is the bandwidth of this event....Historical.
1/31/21, 11:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's truly historical and hysterical :-)
1/31/21, 11:05 PM - +1 (408) 242-5192: Zero chance for Sears and JCP
If you like retail Nordstrom it is a good post pandemic stock and will be around.
1/31/21, 11:06 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Nash bhai... Any prediction for tomorrow? 🙏
1/31/21, 11:27 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I like Target and I am invested in it. Long term. Walmart is good too. If you are talking about brick n mortar retail.
1/31/21, 11:29 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Sears is good ..
1/31/21, 11:37 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Na...One of worst investment of Eddie Lampert. He has hived off all assets to form REIT. Sold most of the licenses. Lent his money to Sears at 8% for short term 6 months and so on...He tried his best to squeeze out his investment. as much as he can. Sold its best performing stores started with Hawaii. All good employee left. Management has no long term interest. STAY AWAY. You have better option.

2/1/21, 10:25 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: Yes and it may go further up
2/1/21, 10:25 AM - +1 (646) 673-0237: So jolding on to it
2/1/21, 10:26 AM - +1 (408) 203-2302: 👍
2/1/21, 10:32 AM - Niteen: Any opinion on CCL and NCLH.. add/ buy the dip? They should perform well in future.. any thoughts?
2/1/21, 10:33 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: It’s looks like the path to recovery is very long. So I doubt any substantial gains in the near future.
2/1/21, 10:33 AM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I am holding both with small loss. Trying to exit if they come into green for me.
2/1/21, 10:34 AM - +1 (717) 385-7085: I had few cruise shares but after holding long, I sold. Better to look for other options😃😃

2/1/21, 11:24 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: We now want them to spare the rest of the stock market, our 401K, other portfolio all has taken toll due to it. I am not saying that they are wrong but this is what has happened due to mindlessness from both sides
2/1/21, 11:25 AM - +1 (602) 327-2049: This is madness bhai... I don't support that. Even i know i will make profit of it, but such things will hit hard in long run.
2/1/21, 11:26 AM - +1 (201) 673-2921: This Reddit group is attacking every where not good for system
2/1/21, 11:28 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: They have shown their might against the biggies who had been playing with a huge pile of money and making the company bankrupt with short trading. 

Also, Fed inability to control the market. RH has lost its credibility. It would have become $80B business, now fighting hard to stay with billion + borrowing.
2/1/21, 11:31 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Listening to the youtube video I shared yesterday, Dogecoin has a good history. It may still reach 10 cents without Reddit boys. It can also collapse to less than 2 cents. No one knows. 

Also, Elon coming out again and favoring Crypto is great news for these currencies. The future looks bright
2/1/21, 11:32 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: India has not touched Crypto in this budget and it is a good thing as well.
2/1/21, 11:38 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: yesterday usdt to inr was down 30/40% so as my portfolio for same india ban reason
2/1/21, 11:41 AM - +1 (510) 717-5804: Friends, any suggestion on United airlines? It’s falling down and I have been holding some stocks. Any idea about its rebound?
2/1/21, 11:44 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It is due to covid restrictions, it has to rebound sooner or later
2/1/21, 11:44 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: IO has hold for it

2/1/21, 11:51 AM - +1 (404) 904-7738: On the IPO news, Rackspace’s lock-up period is expiring. Will be interesting to see how the price moves.
2/1/21, 11:55 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: What is the trend in such scenarios... lock up expire- can bring a lot of stock in market- pushing price down?
2/1/21, 11:57 AM - +1 (404) 904-7738: That is usually the trend. Rackspace has a lot of buy recommendations. I am just evaluating it, haven’t made any decisions. But given the push to cloud, it makes sense that their stocks will likely be a strong performer.

2/1/21, 3:26 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Folks - see if you can get ZOM for $1 

It is around $1.1 target is 1.2 by March latest

Per IO it’s $2 in a year. 

They make medicine for dogs, you cannot go wrong. 

In March the crofelemer drug will be commercialized

As it went high quite a lot, I suggest you buy at $1 

This is Anand Patel recommendation as well and I had been analyzing it for sometime now.

2/1/21, 4:16 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It’s 3X that’s the risk. I have burnt myself so bad Bhai. And that’s all my fault. 

So one should be careful as the risk is 3 times the gold fluctuation. It’s complete gamble. DUST is same

2/1/21, 8:13 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: China growth over the last few decades came with lots of government spending which came with big debt. Unless they deleverage from here it would be tough to avoid bubble. 2.5 times in 15yrs with deleverage is tough
2/1/21, 8:14 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Are wah! 🙏🏽🙏🏽

2/1/21, 8:17 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: right - I will let economists figure out how they will reach the 30 TN goal. In the mean time there is an opportunity for massive wealth creation if the size of the economy grows at such pace.
2/1/21, 8:18 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: India will see much faster and organic growth if you want to explore
2/1/21, 8:19 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: ofcourse, I am already very heavily invested in India
2/1/21, 8:30 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: China is equivalent an opportunity as India, if not more. Due to skepticism from global allocator and historic Trump's rheotoric, it's market is very cheap, and has underperformed its peers over the last 15 yrs. While deleveraging will happen, solid  companies with top notch fundamental will deliver above average return for a very long time. Point being, It is hard to ignore a market that is as massive as China and growing as fast as it is. With its ambition  to become a superpower in years to cone as well as a leader in many of the growth sectors of tomorrow (fintech, AI, EV, blockchain, genomic) there is still massive opportunity for deploying capital.
2/1/21, 8:31 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I have a good allocation to China's MF, ETF's and individual stocks, and am looking for more opportunities every day
2/1/21, 8:32 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: absolutely, very well summarized. The key is to identify the right ADRs and be invested and let the market do the rest.

2/1/21, 9:44 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Will check that too Nash but evean S&P is showing that potential and I feel why look elsewhere when a large index like SP itself is looking. Would appreciate if you can review the Nifty chart too which broke many long term resistances

2/2/21, 9:07 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: TD has the best tools. Their thinkorswim platform is best in business. Also, excellent learning tools. Definitely a notch above any other platform. Only flip side I see is, they don’t allow fractional shares.
2/2/21, 9:09 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: I agree TD is superb if you dont fractional.

2/2/21, 10:08 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You booked losses in silver? Why?
2/2/21, 10:10 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I bought at peak yesterday and it was crashing today. I bought some crap miners stock based on reditt. Stopped loss to enter later. May be a Bad move from both sides sale and buy.
2/2/21, 10:10 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ohk
2/2/21, 10:11 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's normal for silver (SLV) to have such a move
2/2/21, 10:11 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: It seems some big investors planned. May be some hedge fund sneaked in reditt to conspire.
2/2/21, 10:11 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's going between $40-$50
2/2/21, 10:16 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: GME, AMC, NOK, NAKD all on the way back to there original price..  :-)
2/2/21, 10:17 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: @12015655130 @15025540227 is this a good time to take an initial position in SPCE? It has been 50% up in a week and is pulling back today. Should I wait more or start building up today? BTW I added some to DNMR on pull back. DNMR has been an incredible return so far and has no competition in their business category. So ling term looks incredible even at this point.
2/2/21, 10:18 AM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Proactive and strategic one booked profit. Reactive and rest bearing the loss.
2/2/21, 10:19 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Guys...Any bet on Amazon? Any idea if there will be stock split/buy back etc...That might give it an spike?
2/2/21, 10:25 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: As you know I don't typically invest in pre-revenue companies. I need to see demand, revenue, growth, margins and whole host of other items to consider a position. I will not be able to provide any guidance here.
2/2/21, 10:28 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Correct

2/2/21, 10:42 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah, I feel the same fomo like everyone else. However, without fundamentals, it's very hard to figure out if the company can go to the moon, and then visit Mars or will crash back to earth. Point in case was QS. Most folks were bullish here, but after reaching $120, it has lost 2/3rd if it's value.
2/2/21, 10:43 AM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Qs- burned my hands... ☹️ got tempted when it came down from 120

Shareholders of INSU Acquisition Corp. II (the Company) have an option to redeem their common shares for cash at an approximate per-share price of $10.00.
·The offer is being made in connection with several proposals, including the Merger Proposal (collectively, the Proposals) as proposed by the Company during a special meeting to be held on February 9, 2021.
·The offer provides shareholders an opportunity to redeem their common shares for a pro-rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account established in connection with the Company's Initial Public Offering.
·The redemption price may be higher or lower than the current market price of your common shares.
2/2/21, 1:43 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: This is for the Metromile IPO
2/2/21, 1:46 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: @12015655130 I think you had INSU.

2/2/21, 2:08 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: cciv 32
2/2/21, 2:08 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: No idea but worst case you can sell in market at 17??
2/2/21, 2:09 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I have warrant. Any target price?
2/2/21, 2:10 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: if merger announced, i am hearing target of 60/80 at least
2/2/21, 2:12 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: So going to double at least.  Thanks.
2/2/21, 2:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: You have an option, offcourse why would you exercise it.
2/2/21, 2:15 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 👍

2/2/21, 2:18 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: But I'm under the impression I'll get metromile shares when they come on market. Is that not true?
2/2/21, 2:19 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Yea. I'm surprised they would offer so low usually they offer competitive. At least what I thought.
2/2/21, 2:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah its going to automatically convert
2/2/21, 2:20 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Is it true though I will get metromile in exchange to INSU. Do you know the conversion rate?
2/2/21, 2:20 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: 👍🏽
2/2/21, 2:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah 1:1
2/2/21, 2:20 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Great!
2/2/21, 2:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Nothing changes except the ticker
2/2/21, 2:20 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: And good to know my thinking was correct. Just the fact they offered almost 50% below current price threw me off a bit.
2/2/21, 2:21 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Thanks @12015655130 🙏🏽
2/2/21, 2:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah they have cash at $10. They want to be antidilutive by buying share from cash they would not need for growth. But, why would anyone sell it
2/2/21, 2:24 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Yea doesnt make sense. Let's see when metromile becomes public. Expected in Q1 they said.
2/2/21, 2:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Seems like we hit the short term bottom that we discussed couple of days back while stressing that the narrative of the bull market is intact. I look at ES (S&P futures), because the charts are generally clean. The market made a low of 3656 in ES before turning back up (4 points below upper limit target of 3660).
2/2/21, 2:45 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: And seems like it was a buying opportunity
2/2/21, 2:55 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Go Green :)

2/2/21, 3:18 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: I lost by converting ETH to Bitcoin last month. May be in long run it will give me ace but for now it's a loss.
2/2/21, 3:23 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Let Asia wake up..
2/2/21, 3:29 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I dont follow it closely. However I think the following should be considered 1) Stock has high short interest and will be releasing their Phase 1 trial data sometime this week. If it's positive, the stock can do very interesting things 2) The chart looks good, suggesting higher price if bullet 1) is positive.
2/2/21, 3:30 PM - +1 (201) 423-6408: I took a small position
2/2/21, 3:33 PM - +1 (347) 439-8391: Any insight about SENS? Is it a good buy at current price?
2/2/21, 3:34 PM - +1 (832) 931-9979: Thanks

2/2/21, 3:48 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: In TA, when a resistance is hit again and again, it's bound to break (meaning the likelihood is higher prices for ETH)
2/2/21, 3:53 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: i am holding bunch at 2.50

2/2/21, 4:19 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: If target is 140, 22 is also good😊 what do you suggest Nash
2/2/21, 4:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep, it's a 600 lbs gorilla that keeps growing every year. Own it since $1300
2/2/21, 4:22 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's extended, so there can  be some pullback, but consider it do be a multibagger in years to come.
2/2/21, 4:23 PM - +1 (408) 396-9658: Amazon , Jeff Bezos is stepping down as CEO

2/2/21, 4:49 PM - Niteen: This is great..I booked some profit on AMWL earlier..do you think it's a right to enter?
2/2/21, 4:52 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Check put the website of the company. Go to investor section and see their latest presentation. You will be convinced then. I saw it today
2/2/21, 4:53 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Cvlb or amwl?
2/2/21, 4:54 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Cvlb- I am convinced with Nash’s comments 😀
2/2/21, 4:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Don't follow amwell, I like tdoc more.
2/2/21, 4:56 PM - Niteen: Got you.. also CVLB at 22.50 is right price to enter or should wait for the pullback..
2/2/21, 4:57 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: CVLB
2/2/21, 5:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Tough to say. If you are investing for long term, few dollars won't matter
2/2/21, 5:00 PM - Niteen: Super 👍🙏
2/2/21, 5:01 PM - Niteen: Planning to add some with today's dip

2/2/21, 7:30 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I did some review on *OCGN*

Looks like it may never get FDA approvals in US. It’s very expensive and complex. May cost them around 45M. Their Bal Sheet has only 7.4M. They will most likely sell their shares at half to investors. Share price may tank if it happens. Just like how it happened to JAGX as they sold their shares to raise money as well. 

Considering above, you may consider to book profit and exit. 

I have reviewed it with medical industry finance expert. He is consultant CFO for multiple biotech companies.
2/2/21, 7:36 PM - +1 (717) 385-7085: 👍👍👍
2/2/21, 7:37 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 👍
2/2/21, 7:39 PM - +1 (602) 451-9207: I believe, they may go for offering, now a days many are going with that after price shooting up
2/2/21, 7:44 PM - +1 (602) 451-9207: You may be right, 
but without plan (cost for getting fda approval, all expenses)they would not have been an agreement with bharth biotech. This is just my opinion
2/2/21, 7:53 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: Could be huge day tomorrow 

1,400 corporate firms signed up to be personally shilled #Bitcoin  tomorrow by Michael Saylor.

2/2/21, 10:01 PM - +1 (404) 904-7738: The creator is likely angling for a money manager job in 2 years from now. And a book deal. Maybe a movie too.
2/2/21, 10:49 PM - +1 (978) 503-4506: 😀 could have financed own movie and opened own hedge fund or bought one of those companies that he destroyed
2/2/21, 11:00 PM - +1 (408) 203-2302: Not in this list
2/2/21, 11:44 PM - +1 (860) 986-8967: Relative losses , I presume ... 50 million unrealized profit become 37m & probably will be closer to cipher soon.
When your total investment is 15k$, there is not much to lose & he probably will make lot more from popularity/stardom he achieves from it ...

2/3/21, 7:17 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Out simple mind will say that as well. US has its protocol. After the Stage 3 is approved by Indian govt, they will approach FDA. 

Currently India has also approved for emergency use pending Stage 3 test, which will come out good as the results are good with no side effect. The biggest advantage of this is that the vaccine is traditionally made.
2/3/21, 7:44 AM - Niteen: Anyone still considering dogecoin? Any opinion?

FPGAs are supposedly faster and energy efficient - wondering anyone in the group with semis experience can share their experience

2/3/21, 11:30 AM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Ppl who are invested and have profits should atleast consider taking partial profits

2/3/21, 2:59 PM - +1 (403) 560-4022: It looks like Bitcoin moved over support level.
2/3/21, 2:59 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Thats true in stop loss as well 😀. Adv is the stop loss price would increase since u setup trailing loss
2/3/21, 3:00 PM - +1 (403) 560-4022: Yes. This is what happening. Hitting stop loss and then I am covering the same positions at higher price
2/3/21, 3:01 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Seems like there is a mention of Bitcoin everywhere, how is Ethereum benefitting from this, since we are more bullish on ETH.

2/3/21, 3:32 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Was down 20% on this till yesterday, today 100%+ up, good that I held it, should have added more in the dip.
2/3/21, 3:37 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It’s a good long term nvestment for me, did book some profit at 25 few days back, will add more if it goes around 18-19.

2/3/21, 3:39 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I entered it at 21 today, as it is a long term investment suggested by Nash, couple of dollars shouldn’t matter of you plan to hold on for year or so.

2/3/21, 3:57 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It has gained significantly this month, many of us entered at less than a dollar levels and took out our principle.
It has few catalyst like US FDA approval to their 180days CGM which is due in March- April timeframe, if it comes positive this would shoot up, else might drop significantly.
Same is with NDRA, TRXC and quite a few other medical stocks. 
Having said that, I am very bullish on this and TRXC to do well.
2/3/21, 3:57 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: It's a short term. Not good as well as billionaire will get benefits, but this is reality for now ☹️

2/3/21, 4:19 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Same here buddy, booked loss in Nok , my 1k became 700
2/3/21, 4:23 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 1) Bitcoin gets recognition because it's the entry for anyone in the crypto world. But once someone gets comfortable, it logical for them to add Ethereum in their portfolio. For eg, Grayscale added Bitcoin then the Ethereum. Visa too will not just stop at Bitcoin. 

2) Ethereum has an ecosystem that allows the development of other crypto. It thereby attracts the most developer working on it. In tech if you follow the developers, you are following money.

3. Eth has a higher beta and lower market cap  than Bitcoin. Therefore in bull markets, it's logical for it to outperform BTC. At the same time it will get crushed in Bear market vs btc. Timing is everything here. 

Hope this helps!

Vice versa is also true
2/3/21, 4:59 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Currently it’s around 37, so we should hold rt?

2/3/21, 6:36 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: For folks who like to invest in SPAC, but don't have time to due diligence can consider investing in this etf. The etf had 40% allocation to new SPACs (speculation) and 60% allocation to IPOs coming from the SPAC. Given the diversification, you will be insulated from the free fall, if one of the SPAC doesn't work out. It should also perform well in bull markets, where there is an  insatiable desire to invest in some of the shiniest and newest listings in the market. 

Draftking is the largest holding btw, which I own and have discussed here.

2/3/21, 6:50 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Hi Nash,

Could you look into CPSH please, they have received a $28Mn contract from US Navy and now the stock is up 160% today, not sure why no one is booking profit on this, I just took out my principle at 100% gain today, but it seems that there is something.... as investors are still buying it post a 150%+ gain in a day.... just a $28 MN contract can’t be the reason, might benefit the group as well, hence thought of requesting to you to have a look at it at your leisure.
2/3/21, 6:56 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep, outperforming Nasdaq and SPX with a wide margin, so doesn't seem to be a bad addition to the portfolio. I haven't bought it though yet.
2/3/21, 6:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I like it
2/3/21, 7:03 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Agree. I will start with a 25% position tomorrow. I had bought but booked profit in YOLO. Do you still see value there if one enters now?
2/3/21, 7:03 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Just looking at high level, seems like their annual revenues is around $20MM. I don't know if this is a recurring contract or not, but if it is their revenue just doubled from current level. Market cap is $200MM, so seems still cheap on sales/revenue basis, if they continue executing and getting these contracts from other defense agencies
2/3/21, 7:05 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: For SPAK?
2/3/21, 7:05 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Yolo.
2/3/21, 7:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah lots of value, biden just started
2/3/21, 7:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It may pullback because it's extended
2/3/21, 7:06 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: But don't sell your winners eaely
2/3/21, 7:07 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They have good companies in their portfolio, some of them is growing as fast as tech companies but reasonably prices vs tech
2/3/21, 7:07 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thanks.
2/3/21, 7:09 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks Nash, it’s a IDIQ contract, )indefinite delivery indefinite quantity).... not sure if this means that this order is the first one of multiple orders or this is the final order
2/3/21, 7:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Given the market reaction, it's possible it's recurring
2/3/21, 7:10 PM - +1 (347) 439-8391: SAVA?? It went up skyrocketing today.
2/3/21, 7:10 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Also do research if they can get a foothold on other govt agencies
2/3/21, 7:11 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Got it, thanks......will put back my principle tomorrow then... this seems quite big.
2/3/21, 7:12 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: :)
2/3/21, 7:12 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: They are good and have quite diversified portfolio from space to clean energy .... Seems booked profit quite early
2/3/21, 7:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: First ensure if the above is true
2/3/21, 7:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ok

2/3/21, 7:15 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Sure Nash, this profit booking is becoming a pain for me.... sometime I book early, some time I miss to book at all and all the earnings gets wiped out in few days sessions ....
2/3/21, 7:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: No one is ever able to catch the top and catch the bottom perfectly. If it's a trading position, one can put money in the pocket early, if long term investment, let it run until the market remains favorable.
2/3/21, 7:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: *perfectly consistently
2/3/21, 7:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: We all try though

2/3/21, 7:25 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Or buy a little more than your full position. Book profit on that extra investment upon long run to put back on pull back. So you you are satisfying both ie need to stay long and habit of booking profit 😀. I did in few.
2/3/21, 7:26 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Apart from my long term investment I have stocks for which are quite speculative though they are long term but are at a very initial phase, companies like TTCF, FCell, Plug, GNOG, MVIS, DBX, NNDM, NNOX etc, here I am bullish but as the companies are small I try to book profit to be on a safer side, but I guess I need to believe more in them, if they have gained 100% in few months, they will go up in long run as well.....
2/3/21, 7:26 PM - +1 (347) 439-8391: I had 300+ shares until last month. Sold them for 8+ foolishly 😟. Penny wise pound foolish.
2/3/21, 7:28 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Thanks dude, that’s a good idea too😁😁

Apple watch shipments exceed the entire Swiss watch market. There will also likely be a significant 2nd order impact. It could likely expand the broader EV market. And now I am extremely interested in the battery market.

2/3/21, 11:58 PM - +60 19-221 9450: Above article says:
Ethereum has seen year-to-date gains of around 120%, compared with bitcoin's 30%, and hit a new high of $1,576.7 in early London trading on Wednesday.

"The listing of ethereum futures on a regulated exchange should serve to enhance the crypto market structure by allowing investors to gain exposure to the second most important cryptocurrency as a diversifier to bitcoin, or for simply hedging existing ethereum exposures," wrote JPMorgan strategists in a note to clients.

"It may be that this week’s listing of ethereum futures contracts will be followed by negative price dynamics by enabling some holders of physical ethereum to hedge their exposures," they added.
2/3/21, 11:59 PM - +60 19-221 9450: Do we expect some correction as above on feb 8

2/4/21, 6:23 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's a big event so it's possible. For eg, Bitcoin price topped in 2017 after CME launched futures. The key difference is the crypto market was in a bubble then, and this time it's in an early stage of a bubble, so I don't think it will change the narrative of the bull market.  

There are also a couple of other big development coming in ETH 1. Ethereum is inflationary unlike Bitcoin. However they are introducing a EIP 1559 proposal, in which the transaction fees will be determined algorithmically and will be burned each time when a transaction is processed on its network, which will create a deflation in token. 2. The network will convert from Proof of Work to Proof of stake to validate transaction, which means the supply will be further reduced and through the help of sharing they will be able to increase the number  transaction on its network.

2/4/21, 6:32 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Depend on if you are trading or investing. This distinction is important because it helps manage the risk.

 If you are trading, you are willing to risk 1x to gain 2x or better, so your risk reward has a positive expectancy. For eg, you will define a risk tolerance say that I will not lose than 5% in any transaction, and my minimum gains should be 10%, In this way you can protect your downside risk and still be profitable over large number of trades. 

Investing is different, because you have done your due diligence as a long term investor, so you should theoretically be willing to buy more if it goes down. I am always happy if my stock goes down after I buy patiently waiting to increase my allocation.
2/4/21, 6:39 AM - +1 (602) 327-2049: This is great info @12015655130 . Thanks.

2/4/21, 6:58 AM - +60 19-221 9450: What could be the reason? Clearly its not worth or is it we cant assess whats the real worth🥸its very interesting from him
2/4/21, 6:58 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: agree, but if he keeps doing, anything is possible 

every damn one who missed btc and eth will try and catch this in similar hopes

Warrants up 22% pre market. We discussed this at $2.60, so its a 62% gain in 3 weeks. Folks can decide to close their position or hold.

2/4/21, 7:45 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Up 40% now and 80% overall :-)
2/4/21, 8:03 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👍🏻. This is the one I entered at 3.10 🙂. As per strategy going to sell 50%. Which next SPAC should I reinvest this proceeding?
2/4/21, 8:03 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Kudos Nash and entire team who purchased! This was an outstanding guidance from you. People paying $1000 a month for subscription won’t get these guidance. Your guidance is so valuable. 

I missed it as RH doesn’t support warrant but will keep money for next guidance.

2/4/21, 8:07 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: ❤️
2/4/21, 8:08 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: They have an investor call at 8, which I am not attending, but we will have Financials soon to analyze longer term hold
2/4/21, 8:08 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👌🏻. Did you able to buy this? I remember you were looking for a dip to the level of <2.50.
2/4/21, 8:09 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Alright 🙏🏽
2/4/21, 8:09 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Ha ha no unfortunately, but I am confident on CRHC
2/4/21, 8:10 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: CRHC has the largest volume traded yesterday. It is possible that something may be cooking
2/4/21, 8:11 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: CRHC/W is up 12% premarket and is 30% up from $2 discussed
2/4/21, 8:11 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Hoping for a 100% here :-)
2/4/21, 8:22 AM - +1 (201) 920-8226: I have a CRHC position at 1.86 and there was a spike yesterday and is up pre market today.

Looks like something is on the cards
2/4/21, 8:28 AM - +1 (917) 584-6536: @12015655130 thanks for guidance on warrrant, it is new space for me.

2/4/21, 9:41 AM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Musk tweet - “Dogecoin is the people’s crypto” 😀
2/4/21, 9:42 AM - +1 (347) 439-8391: @Nash. A dump question may be you answered it but if you could explain one more time. How do you find the expiry date of a warrant if it sells like a common stock with W in the end? How do you find warrents equivalency of number of stocks?
2/4/21, 9:43 AM - +1 (818) 371-8480: VGAC/WS .. it went up to 4.4 and now started coming down.. Are you all holding it or came out ?
2/4/21, 9:44 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Most folks should have got in between $18-$20, so it soon will be a 1 bagger for them. Hoping this to be a multibagger in years to come
2/4/21, 9:45 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: 🙏
2/4/21, 9:46 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: The business has 12-24 mos to find a target company. 

The warrants can be called by the company in 30 days or 12 mos, but it is not necessary that it will be called, because it's a diluting event (increases the share of the company)
Seperate if the share trades above $18 for 20 out of 30 days, company may call the warrant
2/4/21, 9:47 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Our objective again is to sell the warrant on the day the merger is announced. If we like the target company, we can buy shares to ride it for the long term
2/4/21, 9:48 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: These terms are detailed in the S1 filed to the SEC, so it may vary from company to company
2/4/21, 9:51 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yep, draftking is a swing position for me because it burns a lot of cash and is not efficient as Skillz, it may turn into long term, once they become efficient.
2/4/21, 9:53 AM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Looks all money is flowing from Eth to Doge 😜
2/4/21, 9:53 AM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Short report on clov

2/4/21, 10:03 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Arvind, This is their 5th spac and they have done 4 acquisition before. If you could check how those acquisition have performed (share price growth), it will provide you the answer. If the above looks encouraging, please check the time they took to find a company and share your thoughts here.

2/4/21, 11:43 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I am still bullish on them Ravi, though the stock dint do much for last couple of weeks, but with results coming it should go up, as we are seeing today it has gained 5%, their results should be good too as they have many new SKUs in production and they are in the process of selling these via Walmart, target, Costco sams club etc stores.
2/4/21, 11:44 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 👍🏻

2/4/21, 11:46 AM - +1 (917) 574-3123: I am holding at 2$.. it’s interesting .. It already has business and selling EVs. Recently bought wireless commercial EV charging tech. Only deals with EVfl fleets.. I think it has potential.
2/4/21, 11:47 AM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Great entry point, it should be double digit soon and you will 5x your investment 👍
2/4/21, 12:00 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: The 4th one was canoo..current price is 18 with high of around 24. One concern is they took long time as they formed the company in march 2019 and final merger happened in December 2020. It caught my attention as they have been doing this for a while and this one being 5th
2/4/21, 12:21 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Any thoughts?

2/4/21, 12:41 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It’s the ETF for gold. Crypto is replacing gold for now that’s why it’s down. People see GLD going up by 15-20% Vs a Vs crypto going up that much in a day. 

Every good investor used to keeps certain % of their portfolio in gold (or physical gold). 

Things are changing significantly with Crypto which for some is still an imaginary world. 

Gold will always be gold.  Now you decide your risk appetite. It can go further down as well per analyst for above reason. 

Again one shouldn’t put all eggs in one basket.

2/4/21, 1:07 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: JNUG uncle lost 86% Vs GLD uncle gained 16%
2/4/21, 1:08 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Logically JNUG should have gained 48% or 3 X
2/4/21, 1:08 PM - +1 (403) 560-4022: Yes. I am not confident on commodity ETFs. Good for day trading only

2/4/21, 9:34 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: PINS results

- 76% Y/Y growth (7% beat) in revenue broken into 65% US growth and 145% International

- Monthly active user at >450MN. Added more than 100Mm users in 2020.

- Average revenue per user (ARPU) at $1.57 or roughly 5% of FB's ARPU

- Record adjusted EBITDA at 42%, a 20% improvement over last quarter 

- EPS of 0.43 beat by $0.10 

- Some of the other notable developments and value proposition  include a) partnership with Shopify, allowing their merchants to display their products on pinterest. As you know Shop is one of my favorite companies, as merchants grow in the Shop network, so is the usage on Pins platform, b) Programmatic bidding like Trade desk vs using sales team reducing overhead cost and helping it deliver world class margins c) controversy free feel good social media platform which is massively undermonetized vs Facebook. Ads on FB is annoyance whereas it can blend easily on the Pins platform given its viewed as a discovery engine, d) strong international growth opportunity. 

We discussed this in Dec at $68, so its up 25% from that time. The company is doing everything that it will help position to be a massive revenue generator (ads and ecommerce) in years to come.
2/4/21, 10:07 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: It is a terrific company. I entered at $43 and plan to hold long term. I see it  as a multi bagger in the making.
2/4/21, 10:24 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Awesome price 👌
2/4/21, 10:35 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: It’s good company 👍. I also entered at $43. Small position
2/4/21, 10:36 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I typically avoid semis because they are cyclical. Also, a 30% growth  for a 2bn company is pretty ordinary. For eg, pins per my write-up above is valued at $40 bn just grew its revenue at 76% with a better EBITDA margin. Why in the world we need to look at an unknown name, take more risk as majority of its revenue comes from one customer.

 It is possible it may perform better than other semi's, but there are so many companies that's better than this.

2/5/21, 1:17 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Peloton results 

- >$1bn revenue or 125% growth. Retention rate at 92%. Total members at 4.4MM. GM at 40%. Avg monthly workout at 21.1 (67% higher than last year). Adjusted EBITDA margin at 11% vs -6% last year. Operating cash flow at $200MM (20% margin). EPS of 0.18 (beat by 0.10). 

Full year Revenue estimate at 32% which is highly conservative and they will likely beat by double digit margins. 

The stock is down 8% today, because they cannot keep up with supply. To me this is great problem to have. This is up though 45% from our discussion 3 mos ago.

2/5/21, 5:29 PM - +1 (904) 487-2057: Yes
2/5/21, 5:52 PM - +1 (630) 440-9620: go for that it will block some money but price is 2 so if u even sell 5 calls it will automatically make it covered and block 1k  i guess
2/5/21, 5:57 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Who jumped in? 40% since posted and 25% after market....I guess momentum will continue just on the news that they are filing...Even if they fail to receive but by that time it should have given return.

2/5/21, 7:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Sell BTC close to the highest price before it loses significant value. If you find the BTC top,  you will be able to find the top for ethereum and other crypto.
2/5/21, 7:48 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: +1. There portfolio must be big. Our 1k risk = their 100k :). One day when our portfolio grows big...our risk appetite will also increase.
2/5/21, 7:55 PM - +353 89 940 0945: I will never sell BTC, better to hold for long term
2/5/21, 7:56 PM - +353 89 940 0945: Anyone missed ETH, I would suggest to invest in Polkadot( DOT). This is same as investing in ETH in 2017.
It's growing it's ecosystem similar to ETH
2/5/21, 7:57 PM - +353 89 940 0945: DOT is at very early stage
2/5/21, 7:58 PM - +353 89 940 0945: Another one if someone would like to take more risk then invest in AAVE, a proven Defi
2/5/21, 7:59 PM - +353 89 940 0945: On the fundamental level I will never invest in DOGE, it's purely a gamble
2/5/21, 8:01 PM - +353 89 940 0945: Crypto space is moving very fast so keep an eye
2/5/21, 8:01 PM - +1 (201) 565-7161: What do you think about ADA cardamo... it’s also similar for Eth
2/5/21, 8:02 PM - +1 (201) 565-7161: Cardano*
2/5/21, 8:02 PM - +353 89 940 0945: ADA is good, infact it is one of the pure blockchain
2/5/21, 8:03 PM - +353 89 940 0945: it's good investment, it is going to be strong in next few weeks
2/5/21, 8:05 PM - +353 89 940 0945: But ETH has ecosystem on which you can build others, DEFI is catching up so definitely if you want to invest in crypto technology same tech stock then ETH is best. A matured, proven and scaling
2/5/21, 8:06 PM - +353 89 940 0945: Palakdot(Dot) is also building it's ecosystem and it's catching up very quickly
2/5/21, 8:06 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Heard a lot about this and PAC. Where you bought?
2/5/21, 8:06 PM - +353 89 940 0945: It's available on Binance
2/5/21, 8:07 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Not on binance us..i liked the binance..lot of options there
2/5/21, 8:09 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Yes.. not on bin us. Neither on coinbase
2/5/21, 8:09 PM - +353 89 940 0945: u might be right,I am using non Us version of binance

2/5/21, 8:10 PM - +353 89 940 0945: but I would say go for DOT, do your own research :) just a disclaimer
2/5/21, 8:11 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Dot is good ... It's gone 10 times in a year which is big .

2/5/21, 8:12 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: 👍
2/5/21, 8:13 PM - +353 89 940 0945: it's still in early stage, it's same like ETH in 2017
2/5/21, 8:14 PM - +353 89 940 0945: watch AAVE -- it's my favorite Defi
2/5/21, 8:14 PM - +353 89 940 0945: 👍👍 thanks for sharing
2/5/21, 8:15 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It has grown 70% + in last 5 trading days, however, if you will look into their product portfolio they have innovative products in VR, Autonomous driving etc, which has huge potential, also there are rumour in the market that they could be acquired by one of the biggies, apple/google/MS/Amazon etc, however, there might be some profit booking soon, keep in watch list and add on dips.

Mark Cuban on Aave
2/5/21, 8:22 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Not on RH/E*TRADE. That’s what I have.
2/5/21, 8:23 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Nash recommended that the companies with lesser market cap would have more room to grow, and I agree with him. But depends on ones risk appetite , the green ones could be multibagger in future as our entry points would be low, having said that, most of them have had a good run up in past couple of months, if you want to enter, chose few stocks and start adding few shares and start building your portfolio, but don’t put all your money in one go, go slow...and keep adding at 10% dip or 10% gain.
Rest try to find old messages by Nash, you will get more guidance.
2/5/21, 8:24 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I have been missing many. Need to pay more attention in this group...Bang the table when you buy so I don’t muss seeing 🤓
2/5/21, 8:24 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Miss.

2/5/21, 8:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I wish you luck. 

I would recommend anyone here not to hold bags in the downturn and buy 5x more btc when it bottoms.
2/5/21, 8:34 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: I echo what Nash saying.
2/5/21, 8:35 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: yessssssssss
2/5/21, 8:36 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: @12015655130 what you think for Bitcoin cash? I always feel it is undervalued. Application Performance wise it is much faster than bitcoin.
2/5/21, 8:37 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Deepak follows it more than I do, I like to only invest in biggies
2/5/21, 8:38 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: BCH is no no, many issues

there are more coins better than BCH
2/5/21, 8:38 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: at least i haven’t bought any BCH after last fork in 2019
2/5/21, 8:38 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: I have added a lot in this... Planning to sell all and invest better.
2/5/21, 8:39 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: With BTC, it will go up but i don’t like it

there many good which may give better results
2/5/21, 8:40 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Sure buddy, I recently entered DKNG, SKLZ,CVLB and DNMR. CVLB more or less is in the same level as bought couple of days back, DNMR, SKLZ,DKNG has gained  significantly.
2/5/21, 8:41 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Np
2/5/21, 8:43 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: What you mean by 5x?
2/5/21, 8:53 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Just sold btc at 39400 and bought again at 38500
2/5/21, 9:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: If you are able to sell at 100k, and buy back again at 20k, you are buying 5 times as much Bitcoin by selling and buying at the right time. Not saying these are the levels, but timing will key to increase your btc and dollar value of your portfolio.
2/5/21, 9:16 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Agree. It is hard to time but also taking partial profits at peaks will helps us do that.

2/5/21, 9:38 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Good that I am invested in all these. In DKNG I am champion and bought my 1st stock in 20s. Since then bought and sold many times. Earned good all the time. Still holding. Will keep some for long term and some will trade.
2/5/21, 9:39 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Also send me the home run ones 😜.

2/5/21, 9:58 PM - +1 (630) 440-9620: Should we hold or sell? What is suggestion
2/5/21, 10:04 PM - +1 (630) 440-9620: I m bullish but i wont recommend now... last 6 month
It run some time then go sideway for a month or two and then again it move... so i think it will run between 11:30 to 12:30 for a month and then in march it will shoot up again ....
Long term 23 to 30 depend on their research tech result on lidar
2/5/21, 10:04 PM - +1 (630) 440-9620: Expected in april
2/5/21, 10:05 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: 🙏🏻
2/5/21, 10:08 PM - +1 (630) 440-9620: Do u DD but i m bullish since 2 dollor....
In oct there was a report that mvis lidar tech itself is 2 billion dollor whixh make 12 to 15 per share valuation
But in april lidar works out they will b value at 5 billion and then god know
2/5/21, 10:16 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Here you go buddy... BNGO, NDRA, TRXC, SENS, CPSH, NNDM, ZOM, MVIS& IMMR(I am about to hit home run) NNOX, EH, FCEL, PLUG, GNOG, SNDL. 
These are trading on house money for me.
Below are the ones where I am extremely bullish and hence have either not taken out my principle or added additional cash-
FCEL, PLUG, NNOX,BNGO, NNDM & EH.
For MVIS & IMMR(waiting for results), will add more once it settles.
 Also, CPSH I am waiting it to settle a bit more, will go big on this one.
SNDL- super risky, will take out my house money as well once it hits 1.5 or goes below .9, whichever comes first.
These are highly speculative stocks, please be careful with them.
Missed OCGN, as was tied up with work, these stocks if you are late by couple of hours the game changes hence would highly recommend to follow this group religiously, few of my home runs came from here only. One key message lost is equivalent to few grands lost.

2/5/21, 10:39 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: It's 52 week high was around  5.5, it went upto 8.0+ due after hours to fda approval anticipation, so wanted to take profits at the peak. Monday is a fresh day/week, ocgn could open at 10 currently at 8.6, fingers crossed. Suggest to hold
2/5/21, 10:42 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Will have to clear off my existing laggards and the buy new ones suggested here🙂
2/5/21, 10:43 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Mvis I sold at loss for 2.5☹️☹️☹️
2/5/21, 11:07 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: The stocks where I have mentioned am still bullish could be entered but at a pullback as most of them have had a huge run up in last few weeks, also as these are high risk high reward, I might go wrong, hence please buy in small phases only
2/5/21, 11:10 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Hard luck buddy, I think it has potential to hit 20 in few quarters, same is with FRSX- of there trial goes successful with Toyota, it might also go to moon, again highly speculative.
2/5/21, 11:12 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Dukhti nas par hath rakh diya.. FRSX I sold at 2.62.... in fact there was one more uavs... again sold for 1/4 of what it’s now...
2/5/21, 11:14 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: I got rid of them.. and looks like they were just waiting for me to sell😔
2/5/21, 11:16 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I would suggest, as these are highly speculative investments, diversify and not put more than a grand or two to start with, if you will see my investment, these are so many stocks still are not more than 20% of my portfolio, key is to hold, their products are highly innovative, anyone can click anytime so just put the money and forget!

2/6/21, 11:22 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Mara should reach 30 on Monday

2/6/21, 11:23 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Last time when BTC was 40, how much was Mara, let’s check that
2/6/21, 11:24 AM - +1 (732) 501-3097: If bitcoin will keep $41k+ on Monday, Mara will go 30.

2/6/21, 11:30 AM - +1 (630) 440-9620: PT ticker name
I’ll be buying at open or pullback I do not have a price target

This is a Chinese blockchain.  Could move like MARA or RIOT did.   Could be a huge gainer over time.   Buy and hold type stock but do your own DD.  Setup looks nice. 

Be careful!!!!!!!
2/6/21, 11:34 AM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Guys... Please keep an eye on ETH. Lot's of negative news for it related to gas fees. It may sink as well. Though there has been huge buy and something coming on Monday

2/6/21, 3:19 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: When you buy remember putting limit on the price else you will be paying 1% on market price.
2/6/21, 3:20 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: So in market 1% is charged and in limit it isn’t??
2/6/21, 3:20 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Yes, that’s what I have observed

2/6/21, 4:50 PM - +353 89 940 0945: On paper Aave looks better.

Aave offers stable Interest rates, Compound does not. Aave allows you to switch between stable and variable interest rates, Compound does not. Aave has Flash Loans, Compound does not. Aave has 17 assets for lending and borrowing, Compound has 9.

2/7/21, 10:25 AM - +353 89 940 0945: I would say taking a calculated risk at this stage in Bitcoin and ETH is similar to investing in Amazon in 2009 knowing it is going to head in right direction
2/7/21, 10:26 AM - +353 89 940 0945: I believe Ada is going to outshine ETH in long run
2/7/21, 10:28 AM - +353 89 940 0945: 👍👍 Its in my watchlist
2/7/21, 10:29 AM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I was in it last bull cycle. Same narrative, different time. I think its only work as long as the bull market is alive. After which, it will be dead for years.

2/7/21, 10:30 AM - +1 (614) 707-9974: 100% agree
2/7/21, 10:30 AM - +353 89 940 0945: does anyone have account in etoro? how is the experience?
2/7/21, 10:32 AM - +1 (201) 565-7161: 👍👍
2/7/21, 10:33 AM - +60 19-221 9450: I have in both eToro and kraken. eToro experience os far better but think kraken has lower cost and more security
2/7/21, 10:37 AM - +1 (201) 565-7161: Which exchange is the best one for crypto and less fees... CoinBase pro charging high fee now. any suggestions please
2/7/21, 10:40 AM - +60 19-221 9450: There is coinbase, binance and kraken. In terms of fee kraken is best but user experience wont be that great as I switch between app and website. eToro user experience is best. Coinbase is very expensive while in binance you can’t deposit fiat curr usd so i couldnt trade
2/7/21, 10:42 AM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Binance us charges .075 if you hold some BNB and use that for trading fees
2/7/21, 10:43 AM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Binance us should support fiat deposits
2/7/21, 10:45 AM - +60 19-221 9450: Yes binance us support and would be better

This is good link which explains
2/7/21, 10:49 AM - +1 (602) 327-2049: It was not able to pick market for certain reasons. Development they are making will take them to. Different league. They are getting good back now. May be i am wrong but have a gut feeling that once plasma is launch, their coin value will grow.
2/7/21, 10:52 AM - +353 89 940 0945: Anyone following Tron(TRX), do you think it's undervalued ?
2/7/21, 11:01 AM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Big push from asian giant and social media . It will grow for sure.
2/7/21, 11:02 AM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Follow justin sunn

2/7/21, 11:22 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: @12015655130 @16147079974 ETH has pulled back significantly. Is it a buy at this level?
2/7/21, 11:28 AM - +1 (201) 565-7161: Thank you Vikas

2/7/21, 12:54 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It’s an outstanding work doing all these
2/7/21, 12:55 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: i wish doge goes to 0.5/1 lol
2/7/21, 12:55 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Great insight. 

I think we have to avoid madness of hype and go with fundamentally good ones. We will never go wrong and if we do, it will last for short term only
2/7/21, 12:56 PM - Niteen: Already 6X from here..🙏🙏👌👍
2/7/21, 12:58 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Yes

2/7/21, 1:16 PM - +1 (972) 693-4283: Coinbase does not support trade in ADA. Coinbase does a strict check before adding any coin on their platform.
Just Be aware on that fact.
2/7/21, 1:16 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: let’s see how doge behaves at 0.088
2/7/21, 1:17 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Depends on Celebrities and Musk 😃
2/7/21, 1:19 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Touching 7 cents in itself is a big thing.
2/7/21, 1:19 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: @60192219450 your risk was worth it, atleast for now 😃😃
2/7/21, 1:27 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: I would advise the moment it touch .1, sell 50% and wait
2/7/21, 1:27 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: Because morons will sell and bring it down
2/7/21, 1:27 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: I mean to say other morons whose stake is from .003
2/7/21, 1:28 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: yea that’s plan
2/7/21, 1:28 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: holding a huge bag, i will sell at least 25/30%
2/7/21, 1:30 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Ok will do
2/7/21, 1:34 PM - +1 (412) 915-0706: Potentially even better to do it arnd $.097 or something like that. Higher chances or order going thru.
2/7/21, 1:35 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: if it breaks 0.88 wondering if 0.1 will be right to sell
2/7/21, 1:35 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: btw on kraken doge highest was 0.0073
2/7/21, 1:36 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Let’s wait the 🐕 to cross 9 cents and we see what to do
2/7/21, 1:36 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: will be quick, wonder if there will be time
2/7/21, 1:36 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Musk may be tweeting soon as his 27% will go to Moon 🌝
2/7/21, 1:36 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Oh ok
2/7/21, 1:37 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: All these are good problem to have though 😃
2/7/21, 1:38 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: If at all it reaches 10 cents, there will be lot of investors going nuts  🥜 and buying more. It could be a huge benchmark.

2/7/21, 2:03 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: But when it will go up?
2/7/21, 2:04 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: If you need 100% overnight in everything, that’s not happening 🙂
2/7/21, 2:04 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Nash - you should be blamed here for 2 x 3 x
2/7/21, 2:10 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Lol it is keep on going down that's why asked.
2/7/21, 2:12 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Let’s see if it makes to Nash list
2/7/21, 2:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah, my suggestion will never be 1x-2x overnight. If they go up fast, it will come down fast.
2/7/21, 2:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am typically looking for long term multi months, multi years growth.
2/7/21, 2:17 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: We know Nash Bhai, learned a lot in last few weeks that I’m super clear
2/7/21, 2:17 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: And we look at you always :)
2/7/21, 2:18 PM - +1 (404) 432-7444: Correct.  If something goes 1x 2x overnight feel lucky and take profits.

2/7/21, 5:37 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It can happen and if you see now it happened tor good.

2/7/21, 5:59 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: May be because there are many orders at that price and they are following some rule of FIFO etc? Or giving preference to market and then to limit in FIFO etc?

It's a sign of bubble however as long as you are careful and know when to exit then nothing matters, only profit matters.
Wish you good luck
2/7/21, 6:45 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Well said. For now it’s celebrities and Elon tweeting

2/7/21, 7:05 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Dear All, Do you guys think that we should have a separate group for crypto ?
We are talking a lot on it but not all invest in crypto and other stock discussions are getting missed in these several posts of Crypto.
2/7/21, 7:06 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: I received DM from few players of this group as well but want to take opinion from all.

2/7/21, 7:06 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Separate Group
2/7/21, 7:06 PM - +1 (972) 207-6100: 👍🏻
2/7/21, 7:10 PM - +1 (224) 829-8518: I think it's a good idea, and help keep things sperate and concrete
2/7/21, 7:11 PM - +1 (631) 429-6726: Sounds good create a separate group.
2/7/21, 7:13 PM - +1 (860) 839-6893: Yeah better for who only intrested in crypto
2/7/21, 7:14 PM - +1 (732) 397-9588: Yes 🙏🏼

2/7/21, 7:19 PM - +1 (510) 944-3593: Joined👍👍 so no crypto talks here👍👍
2/7/21, 7:20 PM - +1 (732) 692-0317: Penny stocks also if we have different group that will be good. So we can concentrate only good and long term here 😃 small suggestion

2/7/21, 7:23 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Very good idea. Good if we can limit this to good fundamental long term swing/position bets
2/7/21, 7:23 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: So one for crypto, one for penny, one for LT, one for short 😃

2/7/21, 7:23 PM - +1 (336) 615-5435: Looks like we are moving towards Slack or Discord , where we can set up different channels. Penny/ Crypto/ Options/Long term/ Charts  etc

2/7/21, 7:24 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: Short term position and long-term all same. Penny and crypto are different beasts and they need separate focussed groups
2/7/21, 7:24 PM - +1 (425) 894-7780: Hard to manage multiple group : personal opinion.
2/7/21, 7:24 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Agree
2/7/21, 7:25 PM - +1 (415) 662-3481: All may not join all groups and it will be easier to manage their focus areas
2/7/21, 7:26 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: i agree....
2/7/21, 7:26 PM - +1 (214) 864-9317: agree,
2/7/21, 7:26 PM - +1 (732) 692-0317: Lot of people  lost money with penny stocks. That’s why I was saying better if it has different group.
2/7/21, 7:27 PM - +1 (201) 673-4866: I agreed too. Let us keep stock and crypto only 2 groups
2/7/21, 7:31 PM - +1 (201) 673-2921: Let’s keep diff group for Crypto
2/7/21, 7:32 PM - +1 (412) 915-0706: I agree as well. Two groups only.
2/7/21, 7:33 PM - +1 (732) 331-3713: Agree for 2 groups
2/7/21, 7:38 PM - +1 (713) 446-1016: Agree. We should have only two groups - crypto and stocks
2/7/21, 7:38 PM - +1 (619) 874-6103: +1
2/7/21, 7:38 PM - +1 (631) 429-6726: Agree
2/7/21, 7:38 PM - +1 (732) 910-2569: Agree to have two different groups

2/7/21, 7:39 PM - +1 (201) 875-8138: Agreed for 2 separate groups 👍

2/7/21, 7:39 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Boss has been informed
2/7/21, 8:06 PM - +1 (602) 327-2049: @17325013097 Thank you. This will help us to focus more on stocks here and this way we will not miss valuable discussions. 
Two group, two entity, one purpose -win together. 👍
2/7/21, 8:07 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Ratnesh bhai 🙏
2/7/21, 8:33 PM - +1 (408) 242-5192: 👏👏
2/7/21, 8:37 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: I think for cryptos the minute by minute post causes distraction and flood of messages. Once the idea is communicated there is no need to send frequent updates many times a day for it, as everyone can track the performance on their own.
2/7/21, 8:37 PM - +1 (856) 408-8842: 👍🏻
2/7/21, 8:38 PM - +1 (408) 396-9658: Completely agreed. @17325013097 bhai think if we can do it .
2/7/21, 8:39 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: If people only use this to discuss ideas and not provide update on performance for volatile stuff every few minutes, single group will also work.
2/7/21, 8:40 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: +1. Two are good idea and enough.
2/7/21, 8:40 PM - +1 (408) 396-9658: But we cannot control .
2/7/21, 8:41 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: All are responsible and mature people here, they can self control. This forum should not be used as a live reporting on every up/down tick
2/7/21, 8:41 PM - +1 (646) 673-0237: People can do that on their own
2/7/21, 8:41 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: +1 unless someone sees an buying/selling opportunity that might be lost soon...then flag everyone.
2/7/21, 8:42 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: As a investor i have long term and short term portfolio along with crypto and i will hate 3 groups
2/7/21, 8:42 PM - +1 (614) 707-9974: Crypto is temporary.....
2/7/21, 8:44 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Agree...Lets stop
1)- jokes even if related with stock/crypto. 
2)- let’s not post minute by minute update unless you see immediate opportunity and you want to flag all. 
Between above two we will have messages reduce to half.
2/7/21, 8:46 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: +1. Actually I was in favor of one group. That way you don’t have to juggle between two and kill the momentum....But guess two are managable. But definitely not three...And of message volume goes down I will still prefer one.

2/7/21, 8:50 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: @12817999419 was mentioning that this might be only kids friendly vaccine. If so sky is the limit....But if they not move to next stage or news becomes false then will plung...So high risk high return. Play carefully.
2/7/21, 8:52 PM - +1 (910) 535-5555: + please avoid copying and pasting news. I believe everyone here is fairly well read. It pains to see the same news posted multiple times which I have already read in the morning.

2/7/21, 9:39 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Agree, I am also in favour of one group, even though I don’t invest in crypto, but would like to be informed. 
Would be great, If the minute by minute updates are controlled.

2/7/21, 9:44 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: May be you can say I bought this from top movers list for so and so reasons. That triggers a meaningful discussion for everyone’s betterment.
2/7/21, 9:44 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Or simply inspire others to take a speculative position.

2/8/21, 7:40 AM - +1 (917) 488-0032: I honestly believe we are killing the momentum by having two groups. Let’s see how it goes for next couple of weeks and reconsider with some basic housekeeping rule.

2/8/21, 8:12 AM - +1 (201) 875-8138: In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. As part of the policy, which was duly approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.
2/8/21, 8:13 AM - +1 (201) 875-8138: This is from Tesla’s SEC filing
2/8/21, 8:25 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Wow!

2/8/21, 8:40 AM - +1 (404) 904-7738: I haven't read the articles around Musk and bitcoin yet, but with so much fluctuation in price, how will he accept bitcoins? Or will there be a separate price with bitcoins? Also, will SEC investigate his tweets as market manipulation?

If so, the crypto prices might see a downward pressure.
2/8/21, 8:41 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: He is first in everything he does, his team will dictate the rules of the game
2/8/21, 8:42 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Rest will follow
2/8/21, 8:42 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: With a valuation of 800B company, the best of the best will work (or already working) for him and make it happen
2/8/21, 8:46 AM - +1 (404) 904-7738: I absolutely agree. I liked his previous CFO Ahuja. This young CFO Kirkhorn makes me a little jittery. 😂

Also the oral doses will be used as booster on top of other vaccines.
2/8/21, 10:28 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Few of us are following the news closely. I called up 2 Latam CEOs of Indian pharma and they are very optimistic about it. 

Significant FDA challenges ahead but when India will turn, world will for the vaccine. Every eye on Indian pharmas.

2/8/21, 1:06 PM - Niteen: Yes, I shared that legal info earlier. There's plenty of legal information available online on this. Bottom line is that not all states treating Cannabis equally and it could still be considered as substance abuse. So, the legal advise is that non US citizens shouldn't get into such stocks.
2/8/21, 1:07 PM - Niteen: @12015655130 also confirmed it is as legit information.

2/8/21, 1:12 PM - +1 (914) 623-2917: Another one suggested by @18622901331, GHSI has been good play if someone doing swing trading. I see lot of upward and downward movement in short term.

) (www.healthiercmc.com) is a holding company focused on providing consumers with healthier daily choices with respect to nutrition and other lifestyle alternatives. Through its wholly owned subsidiary HCMC Intellectual Property Holdings, LLC, the Company manages and intends to expand on its intellectual property portfolio. The Company currently operates nine retail vape stores in the Southeast region of the United States, through which it offers e-liquids, vaporizers and related products. The Company also operates Ada’s Natural Market, a natural and organic grocery store, through its wholly owned subsidiary Healthy Choice Markets, Inc. and Paradise Health and Nutrition, stores that offer fresh produce, bulk foods, vitamins and supplements, packaged groceries, meat and seafood, deli, baked goods, dairy products, frozen foods, health & beauty products and natural household items through its wholly owned subsidiary Healthy Choice Markets 2, LLC. The Company also sells vitamins and supplements on the Amazon.com marketplace through its wholly owned subsidiary Healthy U Wholesale, Inc. The Company markets its Q-Cup™️ technology under the vape segment. This patented technology is based on a small, quartz cup called the Q-Cup™️, which a customer can purchase already filled by a third party in some regions, or can partially fill themselves with either cannabis or CBD concentrate (approximately 50mg), also purchased from a third party. The Q-Cup™️ can then be inserted into the patented Q-Unit™️, which heats the cup from the outside without coming in direct contact with the solid concentrate. This Q-Cup™️ and Q-Unit™️ technology provides significantly more efficiency and an “on the go” solution for consumers who prefer to vape concentrates either medicinally or recreationally. The Q-Cup™️ can also be used in other devices as a convenient micro-dosing system.

2/8/21, 3:40 PM - +1 (860) 986-8967: If you see MSTR has outperformed btc from Dec thru now ( after announcing 1B worth of btc buy), I think thats coz it can do what btc can’t do (self appreciate btc) by keep on buying btc at lower value & announcing it later.

2/8/21, 6:44 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: I picked from your notes and reviewed
2/8/21, 6:44 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: I still think TYME has more potential
2/8/21, 6:45 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: $9 is the target 🎯
2/8/21, 6:45 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Per Investor Observer but we should analyze it more
2/8/21, 6:45 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Yeah

2/8/21, 8:57 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: v nice brother
2/8/21, 9:06 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: @12015655130 u r thought on SVAC?
2/8/21, 9:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Looking at their portfolio companies, it's mostly going to be a value company that Starboard could turn around. It may work over the long run, but it may not give a pop that you get in exciting tech, ev, fintech and healthtech plays.
2/8/21, 9:15 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Thank you🙏
2/8/21, 9:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I know few folks in the group like Lemonade and have made money out of it as a longer term play. A better company can be Hippo Insursance which is rumored to merge with RTP (Reinvent technology partners). The warrants are at $4.13, higher than I would like, but the share is $14. This can do well over the long run.
2/8/21, 9:31 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Yes
2/8/21, 9:31 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Mukund Mohan in twitter provided good information on hippo
2/8/21, 9:31 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: Read his thread, if any one interested
2/8/21, 9:32 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Anyone have price target on ITRM ?
2/8/21, 9:35 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: We don't have the Financials yet, however high level looks exciting given the funding they have done over the years, combination of technology and speed of execution, funds they have raised over the years and the most recent growth rate. Insurance are typically cash flowing business if you underwrite appropriately. This combine with its growth rate can be good combo, however I still would like to see the actual numbers.

2/8/21, 9:44 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Sure, Thanks 🙏
2/8/21, 9:46 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Which analyst do you know? I’ve been in ITRM for almost a month and have been waiting a while for it to pop. Was there any sudden news that made it pop? I know that there is a short float of 37%. So short squeeze could send it flying
2/8/21, 9:52 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thanks Nash. So you are talking about RTP ticker right? Also I checked warrant but cud not find ticker for this.
2/8/21, 9:55 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: RTP/WS is the warrant
2/8/21, 9:56 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Thanks bro.
2/8/21, 9:56 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: 👍🏻
2/8/21, 9:59 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Is this an exit at 4?
2/8/21, 9:59 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Needham & Company LLC
2/8/21, 10:00 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: 4.88 is the average consensus target, Needhaam has $7
2/8/21, 10:15 PM - +1 (347) 439-8391: HCMC raised $5 million. Expects a jump tomorrow.

2/9/21, 12:42 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: Thanks Nash for another wonderful pick 🙏🏻🙏🏻
2/9/21, 12:44 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: In the above summary, I briefly touched upon a number of growth areas that China is focused upon to gain world domination. One of their most near and dear focus is to change the future of transportation /reduce congestion in roads and pollution through the use of Aerial vehicles (Flying EV's). 

1. This vision is currently supported by a company founded in 2014 (Ehang or EH). They are the first company in the world to launch passenger grade AV and also have a portfolio of non passenger grade AV.

2. The company has sold more than 100 AV's till date and building a plant for producing 600 AV's annually (starting in 6 mos). It's working with 40 cities around the world to deploy its portfolio. 

3. The company has optionality in a number of areas including disaster management (firefighting), logistics  (last mile delivery, emergency ambulance, offshore oil and gas), passenger (tourism, air taxis) and smart city management (4D mapping, aerial media). Its product cost a few hundred thousand dollars and have 20 mins of flight time in a dense urban setting. The company is heavily spending on R&D to improve its flight time.

4.  The company has received trial/operation flight permits for Aviation authorities in Austria, Norway, Spain, Canada and various cities in China. It has also won the air mobility management in Paris for the 2024 Olympics. 

5. The company has real revenues behind it with excellent margins. In the 3rd quarter, it grew by more than 100% over last year maintaing an annual revenue rate of $45MM and maintains a 60% Gross margins. The company expects to be profitable withing a year or two, which is unheard of for an emerging disruptive company. 

6. Insiders have a lot of skin in the game and own about half the company. Other shareholders include, MS, UBS, Carmigac (French AM with $37bn AUM) 

Risks - Regulatory approval, Flight Incident. The shares are extremely overvalued by any standard. That said, this is a sector that is ripe for disruption. Though it will take time, we will have drones and EV's flying above our head like a sci-fi movie. Not sure if EH will lead this, but they have a first mover advantage in a multi trillion dollar opportunity. I took an initial position yesterday at $72.

2/9/21, 1:26 PM - +1 (860) 986-8967: 👍🏻👍🏻This is one mind boggling disruptive space...
2/9/21, 1:26 PM - +1 (860) 986-8967: EH’s closest competitor is a private German company with slower speed drones & doesn’t have as many safe flights run hours.
I bought it around 41$ last month thinking I missed the bus!

2/9/21, 1:39 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Also they have 68Mn of current asset and liabilities just 22Mn, they can also have 22Mn cash in hand so technically they can pay off their liabilities just by cash in hand

Financials are good too, rt now they have just one store in LV, and opening another one somewhere in California( will be ready in 4-6 months). I entered for CAD 5.6 in November, it’s trading at CAD 9.27. 
Plus this is currently trading in OTC once they start trading in mainstream post legalisation, it would explode for sure.
2/9/21, 1:50 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I know TRXC, very exciting, but they are losing money by the boat.
2/9/21, 1:51 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I have seen this. Its good, but I typically avoid retail.
2/9/21, 1:53 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It was for EH
2/9/21, 1:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Yeah making a W, which is a bullish pattern, if break the range between 3.5 and 4.0 next
2/9/21, 1:55 PM - +1 (917) 406-2999: This is already rocketed
2/9/21, 1:55 PM - +1 (201) 565-7161: Shall i take small position on EH now... or wait for fall down bit.
2/9/21, 1:56 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: FCEL, PLUG, NNOX, BNGO,NNDM,EH, MVIS, IMMR, CPSH are the ones where I am extremely bullish, all have had a good run though and are still running great!
2/9/21, 1:57 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It went till 100 few days back, and then came back to higher 60s, it’s volatile, go slow if you have to enter now.
2/9/21, 1:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's trying to break out of resistance. A small position with add on is not bad IMO. The risk is its overvalued and may consolidate and frustrate folks. If you are patient and in for a long term, sky is the limit for this sky vehicle
2/9/21, 1:58 PM - +1 (201) 565-7161: Thank you 🙏
2/9/21, 1:59 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I will look at the Financials.
2/9/21, 2:00 PM - +1 (201) 565-7161: Thank you Nash. will start with small position for LM.

2/9/21, 2:01 PM - +1 (917) 574-3123: It is new fintech. Canada based. Recently invested in bitcoin. Has an app that let you buy crypto.
2/9/21, 2:02 PM - +1 (646) 744-7953: FCEL,NIO ^^
2/9/21, 2:07 PM - +1 (917) 406-2999: Is it a buy still thn ?
2/9/21, 2:08 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: They got truck loads of money post few share offerings, they are good to operate till the end of 2022 even if they don’t generate any revenue.
Currently, it’s a penny stock so has all the risks associated of the same, there robotics surgical systems are expensive but they got into a leasing model now, this should provide some boost to there sales, but it’s highly speculative currently, don’t think it would interest you much.
2/9/21, 2:09 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: I will share some more details too once done with work
2/9/21, 2:33 PM - +1 (917) 574-3123: This message was deleted
2/9/21, 2:49 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It's an exciting area of growth. I own ISRG, which is the king of Robotic surgery, so I am always looking for names that have a similar business profile as some of their largest cap counterparts in my portfolio.  The leasing model is also implemented by ISRG and is doing quite well. I will keep an eye on TRXC unit economics to see if it improves from here. The risk is that I will miss some  early gains, but its totally OK with me.
2/9/21, 2:50 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Look where is VERU today 😊

2/9/21, 2:53 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: *Veru Inc. is expected* to report earnings on 02/10/2021 before market open*
2/9/21, 2:55 PM - +1 (732) 372-3931: Hi All... Ambarish here and thanks for making me part of this group. I am primarily a LT investor, so I try to gain knowledge before I buy.

Reg. TRXC, a quick read revealed that they have diluted the stock to quite an extent very recently.
January 26, 2021 - TransEnterix Announces $25M Offering Of Common Stock At $3/Share <- Benzinga
January 12, 2021 - TransEnterix shares are trading lower after the company announced a $31.25 million registered direct offering of common stock. The offering is priced at $1.25 per share. <- Benzinga

They were at peak in Sep 2018 at $80+ and today at $4+ level. Why?
Will wait to hear from experts.
2/9/21, 3:00 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Right it still is a penny stock but with huge potential , my entry was quite low, 1.65, so can hold it, let’s see how it performs in next few quarters ...
2/9/21, 3:05 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: It was suggested by @18622901331 , I did try to dig the reason for the fall but couldn’t find it. Not sure if Anand has any info around it. I guess it had to do something with the FDA approvals and adoption to the robotics surgery back then.
2/9/21, 3:07 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: This list has quite a few stocks which has given 100%+ returns to us, all thanks to @18622901331 . 
I refer to it every now and then and try to pick my investments from.
2/9/21, 3:08 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Very good list prepared and shared by @18622901331

TECHNICALS:

$OPTT – Golden Crosson as of 1/19/21

$CIDM - Cup and handle on the daily with a measured move to $2. Stock was up 40% today. Looking for major continuation moving forward here. Today Cinedigm announced that it has acquired Fandor, a subscription streaming service, with plans to relaunch indie film service which closed its doors in 2018. Cinedigm believes they could top 1 million subscribers within 24-30 months. The fandor acquisition solidifies Cinedigm's postion as THE leading global streaming company for independent films. Referenced as "the Netflix of Indie."

$EQ - Initial product candidate, itolizumab, is a first-in-class immune-modifying monoclonal antibody that targets the CD6-ALCAM signaling pathway. The CD6-ALCAM signaling pathway plays a central role in the modulation of effector T cells (Teff cells). Activated Teff cells drive a number of immuno-inflammatory diseases across therapeutic areas including transplant science, systemic autoimmunity, pulmonary, neurologic, gastrointestinal, renal, vascular, ophthalmic and dermatologic disorders. Therefore, we believe itolizumab may have broad therapeutic utility in treating a large and diverse set of severe immuno-inflammatory diseases. 2 hour chart ultimate moving average just crossed over the golden cross indicator and printed a "long." This most likely has a PR coming soon about its prime candidate. Price Target: $8.98

$TBLT - OFFERING announced today. Look for a short term pull back to $0.90-95 (old resistance). Weekly buy arrow just printed on the supertrend. Resistance since June 2020 was just broken last week. The daily ultimate moving average just crossed over the golden cross indicator today, implying to me that this recent move is just the beginning for TBLT. Great swing opportunity here after the offering is complete that was announced today and it pulls back to test new support level. The company is now roughly 2 years away from profitability. Market will anticipate the future new earnings.

$BORR on a healthy pull back. Support seems to have been found around .88-.89. If my calculations are correct. With current ROC we should see a nice run incoming from imminent MA golden cross on the daily chart. There are indications that this move can fail. Def worth watching. I have PT 1.40-1.80-2.40

$KODK - MACD and RSI for any potential breakouts. Watching $8.90 area for a range break. Bullish trend

$AAPL - “Apple’s stock is not detached from a realistic outlook on the future of the business (excluding an Apple Car). If anything, the stock may continue to be a bargain.

While Apple’s stock trades at a premium relative to its five-year average price-to-earnings multiple, at 32 times estimated earnings the stock trades well below comparable multiples for Amazon (58 times) and Netflix (57 times). And of course, Apple shares trade below the 204 times forward price-to-earnings multiple on electric vehicle favorite Tesla (TSLA).” PT: $150 by the end of March.

2/9/21, 3:27 PM - +1 (917) 574-3123: I lost 90% so thought just leave it alone .. Now recovered my losses. I beleive their products are better than ISRG. They didn’t go bankrupt and survived so far 😁 and trying to turnaround. It’s very saturated space. No hospital would install new system and train their surgeons. Also this will increase liabilities for health system. I heard/read free standing surgical centers will be common in future and TRXC may find new business.🤞🏻

TNXP - Tonix Pharmaceutical Holding Corp
Due to popular request I’ve spent the last couple hours looking into this company and I must say, thank you to who ever brought it to my attention. HUGE POTENTIAL

What they do?
Tonix pharmaceutical is a clinical stage biopharm company currently developing and COVID-19 diagnostic skin test called TNX-2100. 
Has many advantages over the current T-cell immunity tests which require specialised lab equipment. On the other hand the TNX-2100 can be administered in a wider variety of healthcare settings. 

Tonix plans to start clinical trial for their diagnostic test in the second half of 2021 - subject to clearance 

Also has 6 drugs in the pipeline including a COVID-19 vaccine. 

Tonix also recently filed for a patent for the use of its TNX-102 SL treatment used to treat agitation in Alzheimer’s patients. 

Catalyst
- clearance to start trial of the -TNX-2100 diagnostic skin test 
Patent approval of the TNX-102 SL
- news in regards to their COVID-19 vaccine in the works
- 6 potential drugs in the pipeline- HUGE POTENTIAL 

Price - 1.64 
I believe this is nice place to start a position and average down on any dip. This company had HUGE potential which upcoming catalyst which is what we love to see.

I will be looking to start a position in the $1 cost range as soon as I can free up cash.

PT - $3 short term and $5+ longer term: huge potential this year if they can get one drug out on the market and begin testing for the Covid-19 diagnostic skin test.

Need to read all these documents. 

In summary - it’s a risky proportion. We have to wait and watch   

1. India vaccine trial success awaited in March. 
2. FDA extraordinary approvals as normal process approvals will not work for the stock price.
2/9/21, 6:37 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: Hmm
2/9/21, 6:40 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Biotechs are like that and this one has many factors playing in parallel. I am holding to it and will be monitoring closely.

The day India test comes out positive and it will, market will shoot and will be hard to catch. 

After that, FDA has to give special approval for use in USA. That is no fun. At the same time, there is no alternate for vaccine for children. Infact, no one in the world has it except Bharat Biotech it seems
2/9/21, 6:42 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Entire Feb will be hugely volatile with shorting looks like. The SEC filing document talks about it all. They have not approached FDA officially yet
2/9/21, 6:46 PM - +1 (313) 980-9989: Any thoughts on NVCN? It’s up 90% today

2/9/21, 6:47 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: I would like to recommend ACUIF, a small Ad tech company similar to TTD and MGNI. It’s fairly small, still OTC so started a small position at $16. But the stock has been on the run lately. Please research and invest per your appetite. 
Tagging Nash for his attention. Your analysis and inputs please.

Revenue up 26% (4% beat), EPS at 0.51 (20% beat), GM at 40%, Next quarter guidance at 38% revenue growth. 

Other notable developments include couple of acquisitions that enhances its software platform, reducing sales cycle and improved installation process (Enphase generates a lot of cash, so company is expected to continue expanding its reach through high value acquisitions adding to the top and bottom line). Announced the launch of its network in Australia and added a manufacturing partner in Europe.

2/9/21, 7:31 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Programmatic ad is the fastest growing field (more so in connected TV) within advertising, so I think all players will benefit in the long run. TTD (due to its network effect and focus on larger agencies vs Acuity) still will continue to grow faster with better margins but it is also significantly overvalued versus Acuity. If they surprise in the upside, this can do very well. Best of luck.

2/10/21, 7:03 AM - +1 (630) 440-9620: Possible with this one. Apprently DARE has a deal with Bayer. They have a partnership on a topical womens health treatment called Ovaprene. Ovaprene just had very good phase 3 results in Dec and has recieved FDA fast track. Dare stands to collect 310 mil in milestone payments for this partnership in addition to teir royalties based on sales. There is some sentiment that this treatment could become the "new frontline treatment option". This partenership and the recent result have caused rumors of a NDA and an aquisition by Bayer.

2/10/21, 3:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: No opinion. Not all Chamath' investments are  doing well (Clover health for example) but majority of them are, so it depends on individual risk tolerance. I will skip at $15-$16, but wait for next one (IPOG) for speculation at $10
2/10/21, 3:21 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Or close to $10

2/10/21, 6:01 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: NNDM has a difficult route ahead, as they are not able to generate any revenue, they are sitting on a Bn dollar cash but unable to find a company to merge with, their 15th management meeting is going to be very critical, it can go either ways.
Their technology is out of the world but they won’t be profitable any time soon, need to see how the market reacts post 15th meeting, to be on safer side, I halved my position today morning @$17.
2/10/21, 6:01 PM - +1 (732) 372-3931: I am here just for 2 days but can’t keep pace with you guys 😄 awesome team here 👍😀

They engaged a company to find a acquisition in European market
2/10/21, 6:03 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Damn...I took out my house money as well from this just before market close at 2.9 as I needed some cash to keep in the side lines. Should have waited and got out of it tomorrow ...
2/10/21, 6:05 PM - +1 (630) 440-9620: Let c how it turn out...finger crossed i m bullish but it already a quite high...
2/10/21, 6:07 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: But they are struggling to find a target company yet, they did mention that the SPACs are making it impossible to find a target at a reasonable price .... if they find one and announce it on 15th the stock will shoot up, but if they won’t it might take a nose dive. Ark is also reducing its position slowly from it...... having said that, it can go either ways, 15th meeting is extremely critical for the stock as per me..
2/10/21, 6:09 PM - +1 (365) 228-1847: Yeah!... I am bullish too on their tech, just taking a chance if I can make some more money out of it.... I am greedy 😜😜😜

2/10/21, 6:19 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: In my opinion I think it will hit $6 tomorrow
2/10/21, 6:20 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: But buy at your own risk because you never know what will happen
2/10/21, 6:20 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: But $6 seems very realistic for it to reach tomorrow

2/10/21, 7:48 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Where do you get the target price? Looking at the resistance or something else?
2/10/21, 7:49 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: **Iterrum Therapeutics** is a Biotech company backed by some very well known prominent industry veterns / team. There primary product is **Sulopenum** which is developed by Pfizer in the 1980s, shelved due to Pfizers other product focus. ITRM's staff is compromised of the well known bio legend - Alex Denner who owns Sarissa Capital. Alex Denner is more prominently known as the head of Carl Ichans bio division who spearheaded his portfolio and knows the Bio industry inside/out. Denner left Ichan's bio portfolio to spinoff Sarissa Capital and leverage his decades of knowledge. Sarissa Capitals' main focus in investing in bio stocks with the intention of buyouts (Denner & MDCO ---  [Medicines company buyout $9.7 billion](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191124005080/en/The-Medicines-Company-Enters-Into-Definitive-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-Novartis-AG-for-9.7-Billion). 

A large majority of ITRM staff and board are from a very well known company back in 2005 Duratta / Vicuron boards. Back in 2005, Vicuron was developing a drug that passed the NDA for andidulafungin for fungal infections. Pfizer jumped in after NDA approval and bought Vicuron out for $1.8 billion as it was a revolutionary drug.

source: [Pfizer buy out Vicuron $1.9 billion merger](https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2005/06/16/Pfizer-Vicuron-in-1.9-billion-merger)


What ended up happening at Pfizer was Vicuron had to now go through FDA approvals. From the little research available back then, it appears Vicuron ended up getting shelved as there was a lot of R&D involved and too expensive to push forward (Dunne link below shows Pfizer splitting off from R&D, trial, FDA approval costs). Vicuron ended up being bought by Durata (source: [https://www.pharmaceutical-business-review.com/news/durata_acquires_vicuron_from_pfizer_091221-2/](https://www.pharmaceutical-business-review.com/news/durata_acquires_vicuron_from_pfizer_091221-2/). Duratta picks up where Pfizer left off, conducted the studies, R&D, and NDA/FDA process. When Vicuron's drug become close, Duratta reached back out to Pfizer to continue the trial study to keep moving forward. Pfizer had to fork up another $6million apart of their licensing deal

**Sulopenum**

Pzier chief scientist Michael Dunne left Pfizer to work at ITRM. He was the scientist behind a lot of Pfizer's major drugs. He currently resigned from ITRM for a new opportunity -- working as Chief Scientist at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Back in 2017 as he was speaking on behalf of ITRM / Sulopenum, he had a very strong positive sentiment to the drug when it gets the NDA / FDA passed:

> While this is an old compound, sulopenem has good patent protection. The IV product should garner ten years of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. due to its status as a “Qualified Infectious Disease Product”. Given that the oral form of sulopenem is an NCE, **patent protection for this version exists through 2028** with the possibility of Hatch-Waxman as well as pediatric use extensions.

**NDA Approval**

NDA approval is set for end of January or potentially first week of February. They had a preliminary meeting back in Sept 2020.

The same board members, staff, and ties on the Duratta deal are now working at ITRM. Almost all of ITRM employees are from Durrata. During the NDA filing review, Pfizer had some senior members during the NDA review with FDA (pre filing). Some names -- Treacy Vargas (worked at Pfizer for 17yrs, retired, and ITRM brought her out of retirement to be head of their submission applications). They brought her in on contract, then after they submitted the NDA in October, she left.

**Sarissa Capital & Alex Denner**

Alex & Sarissa are known from above link and many others of turning Bio companies in to large profitable buyouts. Sarissa currently owns 33% of ITRM with a special clause for obtaining 60% total ownership of the outstanding shares. 

[Sarissa discloses 33% ownership of ITRM](https://fintel.io/so/us/itrm/sarissa-capital-management-lp)

Alex& Sarissa have a clause where after Jan 21, they can invoke the exchange of exchangeable notes to take FULL ownership of ITRM after NDA approval. Sarissa AGM meeting for exchangeable notes. So they have a additional 27% ish to exchange if they want. Starting of the ability to exercise I think is Jan 21 from the filing:

Current outstanding shares is roughly 70-85% are owned by Sarissa, RA Capital, and other institutions / insiders.

**SO WHAT?**

If you haven't read between the lines this far and clued the pieces together, this may be a potential buyout under the covers. Past Durata employees are familiar with what it takes to pass NDA / FDA approvals. Chief Scientist Michael Dunne has been developing this drug and trials since 2015, he also advocates that a NDA approval and distribution would cause this drug to have a EconomicMoat ([Warren Buffet talks a lot about Economic Moat companies](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp)).

The potential here is after NDA and possibly prior to the FDA or PDUFA approval in Mar/Apr, this could have Pfizers eye along with a few large pharma companies. The current market cap of ITRM is around $100 million which is absolutely peanuts when compared to a blockbuster drug (500-1billion market cap). This could potentially mean a large buyout anywhere from $10-20 / share. However a fair warning, this is very speculative play but given the consensus of Durata previous staff now at ITRM, Pfizer drug that is in a market sector that has no new competitor in 20years, and Sarisa / Alex Denner eyeing for a ownership stake of ITRM, the sentiments are pointing to a positive influx of catalysts over the coming months.

This is a 1st mover advantage in a market that has traditionally been stagnant.General UTI drugs have terrible side effects and cause intestine and gut bacteria which results in additional anti-biotics. Selopenum has similar side effects, however, much lower then the older products on the market.

This only caught my eye in the last week. My numbers below are fairly conservative as we will have to see how the market reacts to the NDA approval. However conservative numbers are below:


NDA Approval -$2-3

FDA Approval - $4-5
 
Buyout - $6-8 (conservative) or $10-20 (realistic in my opinion)

2/11/21, 11:57 AM - +1 (214) 864-9317: Alright will add more CVLB.
2/11/21, 11:57 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Don’t have this in robin or Webull
2/11/21, 11:57 AM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Gud to add now ,?
2/11/21, 11:58 AM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It may go down Bhai. Take your call to enter. It has great story
2/11/21, 12:06 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: TD Charges commission for trade?

2/11/21, 12:12 PM - +1 (403) 560-4022: They charge in Canada. In US almost zero commission on trade. But TD ThinkOrSwim platform is best I believe.
2/11/21, 12:14 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: For OTC stocks, they do.
2/11/21, 12:14 PM - +1 (732) 372-3931: OTC Stocks will always have commission
2/11/21, 12:14 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Thank you 🙏🏽
2/11/21, 12:15 PM - +1 (630) 440-9620: everyone do .....
2/11/21, 12:15 PM - +1 (630) 440-9620: for OTC
2/11/21, 12:16 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Not Merrill and Schwab.
2/11/21, 12:16 PM - +1 (617) 991-4614: And it's for long term. So good opportunity to add more or average
2/11/21, 12:19 PM - +1 (713) 540-8300: Check Fidelity i think they are at 0 for OTC
2/11/21, 12:30 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: market is red again
2/11/21, 12:30 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: that's correct
2/11/21, 12:34 PM - +1 (904) 487-2057: This happened yesterday also on the same time
2/11/21, 12:34 PM - +1 (732) 501-3097: hmm...hope it will come back quick
2/11/21, 12:34 PM - +1 (904) 487-2057: Coming up now
2/11/21, 12:35 PM - Niteen: Anyone got BMBL? what should be entry price? Currently trading at 78
2/11/21, 12:47 PM - +1 (347) 439-8391: POSH is up today
2/11/21, 12:55 PM - +1 (630) 440-9620: Is it a good buy?
2/11/21, 12:55 PM - +1 (630) 440-9620: Anyone have any info on bmbl?
2/11/21, 1:06 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: It is a dating app stock. I think we should wait and watch, it will fall from what it opened
2/11/21, 1:06 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Me too would wait for a week at least for it to settle.
2/11/21, 1:07 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Also Bloomberg article is not saying great things about it. Market is down today so it went down from high 70s
2/11/21, 1:08 PM - Niteen: agree.. wait and watch for BMBL
2/11/21, 1:09 PM - +1 (630) 440-9620: Thnaks
2/11/21, 1:11 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: From what I read about it, I am confident that it is a great competition to MTCH
2/11/21, 1:11 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: So good to own both.
2/11/21, 1:12 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: QS was cheetah once and now a crocodile .. had dinner and lying at ~45. @Nash et al - Any thoughts on QS?
2/11/21, 1:13 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I own match which has been a great stock over the years for me with virtually no competition. I will look at the Financials of Bumble once it settles.
2/11/21, 1:14 PM - Niteen: MTCH is already a Motley fool recommendation..
2/11/21, 1:14 PM - Niteen: 👍 agree..
2/11/21, 1:14 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Here for QS
2/11/21, 1:15 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: They don’t have a product ready for few years. And it’s all conceptual. Stay away.
2/11/21, 1:16 PM - Niteen: That's the irony...ppl didn't realize it doesn't have a tangible product until it hit 120+ mark..😂😜
2/11/21, 1:16 PM - +1 (904) 487-2057: <Media omitted>
2/11/21, 1:17 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: The management at Bumble are previously worked for MTCH, they parted ways and started women centric app. So I feel confident it’s a good competition to MTCH.
2/11/21, 1:17 PM - Niteen: 😂 I think they just made prototypes and rest was hype..
2/11/21, 1:17 PM - +1 (904) 487-2057: 😂😂
2/11/21, 1:18 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: 😂
2/11/21, 1:20 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I am sure it is. For 9/30, the user growth is faster than Match. However, need to further dig down to see how both compares, opportunities and valuations
2/11/21, 1:22 PM - +1 (804) 334-8402: Sure Nash. Please honk here when you are ready to take a position. Thanks 🙏🏼
2/11/21, 1:28 PM - +1 (732) 372-3931: That’s right. They came up with a single battery cell which showed great promise. But when you stack those cells to create a battery, it’s a different story altogether. People missed that point and it rallied for a short span.
2/11/21, 1:29 PM - +1 (732) 372-3931: Speculative traders short term gains, nothing else.
2/11/21, 1:30 PM - +1 (713) 540-8300: How's TNXP?
2/11/21, 1:37 PM - +1 (917) 488-0032: Any price target?
2/11/21, 1:38 PM - +1 (732) 476-9114: Otc , then yes
2/11/21, 1:43 PM - +1 (201) 397-6235: PAVM
2/11/21, 2:23 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: As a past user of all the dating apps I can say Bumble is top of the line and most younger people specifically girls prefer bumble over others. Match on the other hand should have a smaller paid user base but they charge lot more than other dating apps. Their only competition is eharmony which is not making many dents on match base.
2/11/21, 2:26 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Good info 🙏🏽
2/11/21, 2:26 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: BTC has screwed up the stocks today 😃
2/11/21, 2:31 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Good to know. Thanks
2/11/21, 2:32 PM - +1 (917) 544-3061: Sure. And btw Tinder, Hinge, Plenty of fish and match are all popular apps and all owned by Match.

2/11/21, 2:34 PM - +1 (201) 268-4316: Grwg is down 15%, is it a dip to buy ?

2/11/21, 2:38 PM - +1 (732) 372-3931: Cramer advised a viewer to take out his cost basis in GrowGeneration Corp 
GRWG 14.43%
. He's not willing to recommend it at its current price.
2/11/21, 2:38 PM - +1 (732) 372-3931: He said this yesterday.
2/11/21, 2:39 PM - +1 (732) 372-3931: I am not a big fan of Cramer though
2/11/21, 2:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: 1st aircraft in 2024 though. Ehang will dominate for the next few years.
2/11/21, 2:39 PM - +1 (732) 372-3931: Agreed
2/11/21, 2:45 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: Got it .. Thank You
2/11/21, 2:45 PM - +1 (818) 371-8480: This indicates that I need to close my position in loss 🙁

2/11/21, 3:15 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: Finally this company is going up. They have very good products and ceo is a very good person
2/11/21, 3:15 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: This company should be $100+
2/11/21, 3:15 PM - +1 (862) 290-1331: In my opinion
2/11/21, 3:16 PM - +1 (403) 560-4022: Symbol?
2/11/21, 3:19 PM - +1 (917) 375-5298: HYLN
2/11/21, 3:29 PM - +1 (248) 826-3513: Any timeframe
2/11/21, 3:56 PM - +1 (630) 440-9620: its a good buy?
2/11/21, 3:58 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: It is a SPAC. Which is the underlying company ?

2/11/21, 4:20 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Thank you! I took on the day you shared the quarterly results. Amazing growth 10X a year
2/11/21, 4:24 PM - +1 (201) 920-8226: Honestly, I never thought this company will work simply because I thought their model can be easily replicated.
I was so wrong !
They are doing amazing and it reflects in the growth of their stock prices.
Today again it is on Fool’s Best Buy now !
2/11/21, 4:25 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: We will have no idea how this will grow. They have given the feel of Amazon to buy the service. It could be Amazon for IT services.
2/11/21, 4:26 PM - +1 (281) 799-9419: Kindly do your DD friends before entering. I am an extremist in my views so pls don’t listen to me. Listen to Nash 🙏🏽
2/11/21, 4:26 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Good to know that it's in the Fools best buy list
2/11/21, 4:27 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Don't listen to me too. Listen to the numbers. They never lie.

2/11/21, 5:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: It was $200 2 weeks back and have gained 50%. That said, it broke its resistance and now all time high
2/11/21, 5:12 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Not trying to time these, but putting in the portfolio for longer term holds

2/11/21, 6:19 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Crowdstrike is one of the largest position in my portfolio. I own it at $70, discussed here 4 mos ago at $125 and now is at $235. It has not done much over the last few weeks, but can it do 2x in the next 3-5yrs. I will be surprised if it doesn't do that (assuming market conditions are normal)

2/11/21, 6:32 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Motley fool may not have this as one of their largest position though. It is a category killer in addressing cybersecurity needs through AI and Big data for the digitized world. Grown almost 100% since 2017, have a $40 bn total addressable market with current revenues less than 2% of that market.

2/11/21, 10:06 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: All my life was against censorship or free speech. But VIPs can move masses so they should either exercise restraint or be forced to do so.
Instead of he ditching (Facebook) recommending (Telegram) social media apps, twitter should now warn him.

2/11/21, 10:09 PM - +1 (408) 905-7058: So many common men are also on right paths. None of them has same number of followers.

Speaking of stocks, it may not hurt to buy his unqualified and uneducated recommendations for short term 😀

They came in spotlight due to COVID and again no output from them yet. It went to $30+ in June 2020 but now back to where it belongs.

2/12/21, 1:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: I typically look at multi year hold. Citron will have  a $140 price target for it. Atleast we can do half of that.
2/12/21, 1:39 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: So yes, CVLB has a lot of room to grow, however since it's extended, don't be disappointed if it consolidates for some time

2/12/21, 4:57 PM - +1 (201) 565-5130: Probably reacting to cloudfare news of 36% guidance for next year. Same industry group

For cloudfare, they gave a similar mid 30% guidance  in 2019 also, but they grew by 50% in 2020. As the economy returns to normal in the 2nd half of the year and small businesses opens, hard to believe that they will not again beat their conservative guidance this time around.

 Alternatively, they will be left behind in the decentralized ecosystem the world is building. I'd history is a guide, the Government will have to change it policies based on what people want rather than the other way around.
2/12/21, 6:08 PM - +1 (973) 405-0388: Question for the crypto experienced guys here. I had read
